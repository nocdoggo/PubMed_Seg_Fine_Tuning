medically actionable and may inform hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) 
treatment and prevention. However, rates of germline genetic testing (GT) in 
people with and without cancer are suboptimal. Individuals' knowledge, 
attitudes, and beliefs may influence GT decisions. While genetic counseling (GC) 
provides decision support, the supply of genetic counselors is insufficient to 
meet demand. Accordingly, there is a need to explore the evidence on 
interventions that aim to support BRCA1/2 testing decisions. We conducted a 
scoping review of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO using search 
terms related to HBOC, GT, and decision making. First, we screened records to 
identify peer-reviewed reports that described interventions to support BRCA1/2 
testing decisions. Next, we reviewed full-text reports and excluded studies that 
lacked statistical comparisons or enrolled previously tested individuals. 
Finally, we extracted study characteristics and findings into a table. All 
records and reports were reviewed independently by two authors; decisions were 
tracked in Rayyan, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Of 2116 
unique citations, 25 met the eligibility criteria. Articles were published 
between 1997 and 2021 and described randomized trials and nonrandomized, 
quasi-experimental studies. Most studies tested technology-based (12/25, 48%) or 
written (9/25, 36%) interventions. Nearly half (12/25, 48%) of interventions 
were designed to complement traditional GC. Of the interventions compared to GC, 
75% (6/8) increased or had a noninferior effect on knowledge, and 67% (4/6) 
decreased or had a noninferior effect on decisional conflict. Intervention 
effects on GT uptake were mixed, which may reflect evolving eligibility criteria 
for GT. Our findings suggest novel interventions may promote informed GT 
decision making, but many were developed to complement traditional GC. Trials 
that assess the effects of decision support interventions in diverse samples and 
evaluate implementation strategies for efficacious interventions are warranted.",© 2023 National Society of Genetic Counselors.,"DOI: 10.1002/jgc4.1738

breast cancer later in her life, should reduce the number of breast cancer 
deaths. Different predictive models exist for breast cancer based on family 
history, BRCA status, and SNP analysis. The best of these models has an accuracy 
(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) of about 0.65. We 
have developed computational methods to characterize a genome by a small set of 
numbers that represent the length of segments of the chromosomes, called 
chromosomal-scale length variation (CSLV).
METHODS: We built machine learning models to differentiate between women who had 
breast cancer and women who did not based on their CSLV characterization. We 
applied this procedure to two different datasets: the UK Biobank (1534 women 
with breast cancer and 4391 women who did not) and the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) 874 with breast cancer and 3381 without.
RESULTS: We found a machine learning model that could predict breast cancer with 
an AUC of 0.836 95% CI (0.830.0.843) in the UK Biobank data. Using a similar 
approach with the TCGA data, we obtained a model with an AUC of 0.704 95% CI 
(0.702, 0.706). Variable importance analysis indicated that no single 
chromosomal region was responsible for significant fraction of the model 
results.
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, chromosomal-scale length variation 
could effectively predict whether or not a woman enrolled in the UK Biobank 
study developed breast cancer.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40246-023-00482-8

transabdominal specimen extraction (TASE) in colorectal surgery remains 
controversial. Herein, we aimed to perform a retrospective analysis on surgical 
outcomes of NOSE and TASE at three hospitals in east of Iran.
METHOD: Consecutive locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma patients who 
underwent laparoscopic surgery using either NOSE or TASE from 2011 to 2017 were 
recruited. These patients were followed-up till 2020. Data, including 
postoperative complications, long-term overall and recurrence-free survival were 
analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: 239 eligible patients were included in this study. 169 (70.71%) 
patients underwent NOSE, and 70 (29.29%) patients underwent TASE. Although this 
study has achieved similar outcomes in terms of overall and recurrence-free 
survival, metastasis, circumferential margin involvement as well as 
complications of intra-operative bleeding, obstruction, anastomosis-fail, 
rectovaginal-fistula in women and pelvic collection/abscess in both groups, we 
observed higher rates of locoregional recurrence, incontinency, stenosis and the 
close distal margins involvement in NOSE group and also obstructed defecation 
syndrome in TASE cases.
CONCLUSION: According to our findings, NOSE laparoscopic surgery showed 
significantly higher incontinency, impotency, stenosis and involvement of the 
close distal margins rates. Nevertheless, considering the similarity of 
long-term overall and recurrence-free survival, metastasis, circumferential 
margin involvement, NOSE procedure is still could be considered as a second 
choice for lower rectal adenocarcinoma patients.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12893-023-02059-7

(#)Contributed equally","Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, a key RNA modification widely found in 
eukaryotes, is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). Such RNA 
editing destabilizes endogenous dsRNAs, which are subsequently recognized by the 
sensors of innate immune and other proteins as autologous dsRNAs. This prevents 
the activation of innate immunity and type I interferon-mediated responses, 
thereby reducing the downstream cell death induced by the activation of the 
innate immune sensing system. ADARs-mediated editing can also occur in mRNAs and 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in different species. In mRNAs, A-to-I editing may lead 
to missense mutations and the selective splicing of coding regions. Meanwhile, 
in ncRNAs, A-to-I editing may affect targeting and disrupt ncRNAs maturation, 
leading to anomalous cell proliferation, invasion, and responses to 
immunotherapy. This review highlights the biological functions of A-to-I 
editing, its role in regulating innate immunity and cell death, and its 
potential molecular significance in tumorigenesis and cancer targeted therapy

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Multiple vaccines have been approved since August 2021 to prevent 
infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, 20-40% of immunocompromised people fail to 
develop SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination and remain at 
high risk of infection and more severe illness than non-immunocompromised hosts. 
Sotrovimab (VIR-7831) is a monoclonal neutralizing antibody that binds a 
conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It is neither renally 
excreted nor metabolized by P450 enzymes and therefore unlikely to interact with 
concomitant medications (e.g., immunosuppressive medications). In this 
open-label feasibility study protocol, we will define the optimal dose and 
dosing interval of sotrovimab as pre-exposure prophylaxis for immunocompromised 
individuals as well as its safety and tolerability in this population 
specifically.
METHODS: We will enroll 93 eligible immunocompromised adults with a negative or 
low-positive (< 50 U/mL) SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. In phase 1, the first 10 
patients will participate in a lead-in pharmacokinetics (PK) cohort study to 
determine the optimal dosing interval. Phase 2 will expand this population to 50 
participants to examine rates of infusion-related reactions (IRR) with a 30-min 
500 mg sotrovimab IV infusion. Phase 3 will be an expansion cohort for further 
assessment of the safety and tolerability of sotrovimab. In phase 4, the first 
10 patients receiving 2000 mg IV of sotrovimab on the second sotrovimab infusion 
day will comprise a lead-in safety cohort that will inform the duration of 
observation following administration of the drug. The patients will be followed 
for safety and COVID-19 events for 36 weeks after the second dose.
DISCUSSION: In a previous phase III randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal 
trial, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of adverse events 
in patients receiving sotrovimab vs. placebo. Thus, we propose an open-label 
feasibility study protocol of sotrovimab as pre-exposure prophylaxis for 
immunocompromised individuals to evaluate its PK in immunocompromised 
individuals with impaired SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity and define optimal dosing 
intervals. We also aim to determine COVID-19 infections over the study period 
and self-reported quality of life measures throughout the study.

(#)Contributed equally","Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) are brain tumors occurring in children and 
adolescents associated with a dismal prognosis despite existing treatments. 
Therapeutic failure in both adult and pHGG has been partially imputed to glioma 
stem cells (GSC), a subset of cancer cells endowed with stem-like cell potential 
and malignant, invasive, adaptative, and treatment-resistant capabilities. 
Whereas GSC have largely been portrayed in adult tumors, less information has 
been provided in pHGG. The aim of our study was to comprehensively document the 
stem-like capacities of seven in-use pediatric glioma cell cultures (Res259, 
UW479, SF188, KNS42, SF8628, HJSD-DIPG-007 and HJSD-DIPG-012) using parallel in 
vitro assays assessing stem cell-related protein expression, multipotency, 
self-renewal and proliferation/quiescence, and in vivo investigation of their 
tumorigenicity and invasiveness. Data obtained from in vitro experiments 
revealed glioma subtype-dependent expression of stem cell-related markers and 
varying abilities for differentiation, self-renewal, and 
proliferation/quiescence. Among tested cultures, DMG H3-K27 altered cultures 
displayed a particular pattern of stem-like markers expression and a higher 
fraction of cells with self-renewal potential. Four cultures displaying 
distinctive stem-like profiles were further tested for their ability to initiate 
tumors and invade the brain tissue in mouse orthotopic xenografts. The selected 
cell cultures all showed a great tumor formation capacity, but only DMG H3-K27 
altered cells demonstrated a highly infiltrative phenotype. Interestingly, we 
detected DMG H3-K27 altered cells relocated in the subventricular zone (SVZ), 
which has been previously described as a neurogenic area, but also a potential 
niche for brain tumor cells. Finally, we observed an SVZ-induced phenotypic 
modulation of the glioma cells, as evidenced by their increased proliferation 
rate. In conclusion, this study recapitulated a systematic stem-like profiling 
of various pediatric glioma cell cultures and call to a deeper characterization 
of DMG H3-K27 altered cells nested in the SVZ.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40478-023-01586-x

gastrointestinal cancers and has a high incidence and mortality around the 
world. To suppress the progression of GC, it is essential to develop diagnostic 
markers. MicroRNAs regulate GC development, but a clearer insight into their 
role is needed before they can be applied as a molecular markers and targets.
METHODS: In this study, we assessed the diagnostic value of differentially 
expressed microRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers for GC using data for 389 
tissue samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 21 plasma samples from GC 
patients.
RESULTS: The expression of hsa-miR-143-3p (also known as hsa-miR-143) was 
significantly downregulated in GC according to the TCGA data and plasma samples. 
The 228 potential target genes of hsa-miR-143-3p were analyzed using a 
bioinformatics tool for miRNA target prediction. The target genes correlated 
with extracellular matrix organization, the cytoplasm, and identical protein 
binding. Furthermore, the pathway enrichment analysis of target genes showed 
that they were involved in pathways in cancer, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, and proteoglycans in cancer. 
The hub genes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, were matrix 
metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), CD44 molecule (CD44), and SMAD family member 3 
(SMAD3).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that hsa-miR-143-3p may be used as a diagnostic 
marker for GC, contributing via the pathways involved in the development of GC.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12920-023-01554-3

public health concern worldwide. Currently, more than 6 million deaths have 
occurred despite drastic containment measures, and this number is still 
increasing. Currently, no standard therapies for COVID-19 are available, which 
necessitates identifying effective preventive and therapeutic agents against 
COVID-19. However, developing new drugs and vaccines is a time-consuming 
process, and therefore, repurposing the existing drugs or redeveloping related 
targets seems to be the best strategy to develop effective therapeutics against 
COVID-19. Autophagy, a multistep lysosomal degradation pathway contributing to 
nutrient recycling and metabolic adaptation, is involved in the initiation and 
progression of numerous diseases as a part of an immune response. The key role 
of autophagy in antiviral immunity has been extensively studied. Moreover, 
autophagy can directly eliminate intracellular microorganisms by selective 
autophagy, that is, ""xenophagy."" However, viruses have acquired diverse 
strategies to exploit autophagy for their infection and replication. This review 
aims to trigger the interest in the field of autophagy as an antiviral target 
for viral pathogens (with an emphasis on COVID-19). We base this hypothesis on 
summarizing the classification and structure of coronaviruses as well as the 
process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication; providing the common 
understanding of autophagy; reviewing interactions between the mechanisms of 
viral entry/replication and the autophagy pathways; and discussing the current

hybridization (FISH) indicated that miR-27b-3p was enriched in MSC-ex and 
exosomal miR-27b-3p repressed Yes-associated protein (YAP) expression by 
targeting its 3' untranslated region in LX-2. LOXL2 was identified as a novel 
downstream target gene of YAP, and YAP bound to the LOXL2 promoter to positively 
regulate transcription. Additionally, the miR-27b-3p inhibitor abrogated the 
anti-LOXL2 abilities of MSC-ex and diminished the antifibrotic efficacy. 
miR-27b-3p overexpression promoted MSC-ex mediated YAP/LOXL2 inhibition. Thus, 
MSC-ex may suppress LOXL2 expression through exosomal miR-27b-3p mediated YAP 
down-regulation. The findings here may improve our understanding of MSC-ex in 
liver fibrosis alleviation and provide new opportunities for clinical treatment.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12951-023-01942-y

naturally or synthesized chemically and has antihistaminic, antioxidant, 
antitumor, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to design and synthesize a novel series of 
carbazole derivatives and evaluate their antiproliferative and antioxidant 
activities.
METHODS: The synthesized compounds were characterized utilizing HRMS, 1H-, and 
13CAPT-NMR, and assessed for their anticancer, antifibrotic, and antioxidant 
effects utilizing reference biomedical procedures. In addition, the AutoDock 
Vina application was used to perform in-silico docking computations.
RESULTS: A series of carbazole derivatives were synthesized and characterized in 
the current study. Compounds 10 and 11 were found to have a stronger 
antiproliferative effect than compounds 2-5 against HepG2, HeLa, and MCF7 cancer 
cell lines with IC50 values of 7.68, 10.09, and 6.44 µM, respectively. Moreover, 
compound 9 showed potent antiproliferative activity against HeLa cancer cell 
lines with an IC50 value of 7.59 µM. However, except for compound 5, all of the 
synthesized compounds showed moderate antiproliferative activities against 
CaCo-2 with IC50 values in the range of 43.7-187.23 µM. All of these values were 
compared with the positive control anticancer drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). In 
addition, compound 9 showed the most potent anti-fibrotic compound, and the 
cellular viability of LX-2 was found 57.96% at 1 µM concentration in comparison 
with the positive control 5-FU. Moreover, 4 and 9 compounds showed potent 
antioxidant activities with IC50 values of 1.05 ± 0.77 and 5.15 ± 1.01 µM, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Most of the synthesized carbazole derivatives showed promising 
antiproliferative, antioxidant, and antifibrotic biological effects, and further 
in-vivo investigations are needed to approve or disapprove these results.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13065-023-00961-y

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a serious complication of radiotherapy 
for head and neck cancer (HNC). However, its etiology and pathogenesis have not 
been completely elucidated. Recent studies suggest the involvement of the oral 
microbiota in the development of ORN. The aim of this study was to assess the 
correlation between oral microbiota and the extent of bone resorption in ORN 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who received high-dose radiotherapy for 
HNC were enrolled. Tissue specimens were collected from the unaffected and 
affected sides. The diversity, species differences and marker species of the 
oral microbial community were determined by 16 S rRNA sequencing and 
bioinformatics analysis.
RESULTS: The ORN group had greater microbial abundance and species diversity. 
The relative abundance of f_Prevotellaceaeand, f_Fusobacteriaceae, 
f_Porphyromonadaceae, f_Actinomycetaceae, f_Staphylococcaceae, g_Prevotella, 
g_Staphylococcus, s_Endodontalis and s_Intermedia were particular;y increased in 
ORN, suggesting a potential association between the oral microbiota and ORN. 
Furthermore, g_Prevotella, g_Streptococcus, s_parvula and s_mucilaginosa were 
identified as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of ORN. Association 
network analysis also suggested an overall imbalance in species diversity and 
ecological diversity in the oral microbiota of ORN patients. In addition, 
pathway analysis indicated that the dominant microbiota in ORN may disrupt bone 
regeneration by regulating specific metabolic pathways that increase 
osteoclastic activity.
CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced ORN is associated with significant changes in the 
oral microbiota, and the latter may play a potential role in the etiopathology 
of post-radiation ORN. The exact mechanisms through which the oral microbiota 
influence osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis remain to be elucidated.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-04219-y

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Tumor cells with the capability of radiation resistance can escape 
the fate of cell death after radiotherapy, serving as the main cause of 
treatment failure. Repopulation of tumors after radiotherapy is dominated by 
this group of residual cells, which greatly reduce the sensitivity of recurrent 
tumors to the therapy, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, revealing 
the mechanism of radiation resistant cells participating in tumor repopulation 
is of vital importance for cancer patients to obtain a better prognosis.
METHODS: Co-expressed genes were searched by using genetic data of radiation 
resistant cells (from GEO database) and TCGA colorectal cancer. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to define the most 
significant co-expressed genes for establishing prognostic indicator. Logistic 
analysis, WGCNA analysis, and other types of tumors were included to verify the 
predictive ability of the indicator. RT-qPCR was carried out to test expression 
level of key genes in colorectal cancer cell lines. Colongenic assay was 
utilized to test the radio-sensitivity and repopulation ability of key gene 
knockdown cells.
RESULTS: Prognostic indicator based on TCGA colorectal cancer patients 
containing four key radiation resistance genes (LGR5, KCNN4, TNS4, CENPH) was 
established. The indicator was shown to be significantly correlated with the 
prognosis of colorectal cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, and also had an 
acceptable predictive effect in the other five types of cancer. RT-qPCR showed 
that expression level of key genes was basically consistent with the radiation 
resistance level of colorectal cancer cells. The clonogenic ability of all key 
gene knockdown cells decreased after radiation treatment compared with the 
control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that LGR5, KCNN4, TNS4 and CENPH are correlated 
with radiation sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells, and the indicator 
composed by them can reflect the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients 
undergoing radiation therapy. Our data provide an evidence of radiation 
resistant tumor cells involved in tumor repopulation, and give patients 
undergoing radiotherapy an approving prognostic indicator with regard to tumor 
progression.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-04260-x

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Early detection is critical for improving the survival of breast 
cancer (BC) patients. Exhaled breath testing as a non-invasive technique might 
help to improve BC detection. However, the breath test accuracy for BC diagnosis 
is unclear.
METHODS: This multi-center cohort study consecutively recruited 5047 women from 
four areas of China who underwent BC screening. Breath samples were collected 
through standardized breath collection procedures. Volatile organic compound 
(VOC) markers were identified from a high-throughput breathomics analysis by the 
high-pressure photon ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPPI-TOFMS). 
Diagnostic models were constructed using the random forest algorithm in the 
discovery cohort and tested in three external validation cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 465 (9.21%) participants were identified with BC. Ten 
optimal VOC markers were identified to distinguish the breath samples of BC 
patients from those of non-cancer women. A diagnostic model (BreathBC) 
consisting of 10 optimal VOC markers showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.87 in external validation cohorts. BreathBC-Plus, which combined 10 VOC 
markers with risk factors, achieved better performance (AUC = 0.94 in the 
external validation cohorts), superior to that of mammography and ultrasound. 
Overall, the BreathBC-Plus detection rates were 96.97% for ductal carcinoma in 
situ, 85.06%, 90.00%, 88.24%, and 100% for stages I, II, III, and IV BC, 
respectively, with a specificity of 87.70% in the external validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study on breath tests to date. Considering the 
easy-to-perform procedure and high accuracy, these findings exemplify the 
potential applicability of breath tests in BC screening.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13045-023-01459-9

leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women. Our previous study 
revealed that high HMGB3 levels are associated with poor prognosis and lymph 
node metastasis in patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma; however, 
the role of HMGB3 in EOC proliferation and metastasis remains unknown.
METHODS: MTT, clonogenic, and EdU assays were used to assess cell proliferation. 
Transwell assays were performed to detect cell migration and invasion. Signaling 
pathways involved in HMGB3 function were identified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). 
MAPK/ERK signaling pathway protein levels were evaluated by western blot.
RESULTS: HMGB3 knockdown inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and 
metastasis, whereas HMGB3 overexpression facilitated these processes. RNA-seq 
showed that HMGB3 participates in regulating stem cell pluripotency and the MAPK 
signaling pathway. We further proved that HMGB3 promotes ovarian cancer 
stemness, proliferation, and metastasis through activating the MAPK/ERK 
signaling pathway. In addition, we demonstrated that HMGB3 promotes tumor growth 
in a xenograft model via MAPK/ERK signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: HMGB3 promotes ovarian cancer malignant phenotypes and stemness 
through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Targeting HMGB3 is a promising strategy 
for ovarian cancer treatment that may improve the prognosis of women with this 
disease. Video Abstract.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12964-023-01172-7

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: As a core member of the FA complex, in the Fanconi anemia pathway, 
FAAP24 plays an important role in DNA damage repair. However, the association 
between FAAP24 and patient prognosis in AML and immune infiltration remains 
unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore its expression 
characteristics, immune infiltration pattern, prognostic value and biological 
function using TCGA-AML and to verify it in the Beat AML cohort.
METHODS: In this study, we examined the expression and prognostic value of 
FAAP24 across cancers using data from TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, and GEPIA2. To further 
investigate the prognosis in AML, development and validation of a nomogram 
containing FAAP24 were performed. GO/KEGG, ssGSEA, GSVA and xCell were utilized 
to explore the functional enrichment and immunological features of FAAP24 in 
AML. Drug sensitivity analysis used data from the CellMiner website, and the 
results were confirmed in vitro.
RESULTS: Integrated analysis of the TCGA, TARGET and GTEx databases showed that 
FAAP24 is upregulated in AML; meanwhile, high FAAP24 expression was associated 
with poor prognosis according to GEPIA2. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed 
that FAAP24 is implicated in pathways involved in DNA damage repair, the cell 
cycle and cancer. Components of the immune microenvironment using xCell indicate 
that FAAP24 shapes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in AML, 
which helps to promote AML progression. Drug sensitivity analysis showed a 
significant correlation between high FAAP24 expression and chelerythrine 
resistance. In conclusion, FAAP24 could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker 
and play an immunomodulatory role in AML.

with non-resectable pancreatic cancer (PC) is combination chemotherapy, whereas 
frail patients are recommended gemcitabine (Gem) monotherapy. Randomized 
controlled trials in colorectal cancer and a post-hoc analysis of gemcitabine 
and nab-paclitaxel (GemNab) in PC suggest, however, that reduced dose of 
combination chemotherapy may be feasible and more efficient compared to 
monotherapy in frail patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether 
reduced dose GemNab is superior to full dose Gem in patients with resectable PC, 
who are not candidates for full dose combination chemotherapy in first line.
METHODS: The Danish Pancreas Cancer Group (DPCG)-01 trial is a national 
multicenter prospective randomized phase II trial. A total of 100 patients in 
ECOG performance status 0-2 with non-resectable PC, not candidate for full dose 
combination chemotherapy in first line, but eligible for full dose Gem, will be 
included. Patients are randomized 1:1 to either full dose Gem or GemNab in 80% 
of recommended dose. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. 
Secondary endpoints are overall survival, overall response rate, quality of 
life, toxicity and rate of hospitalizations during treatment. The correlation 
between blood inflammatory markers, including YKL-40 and IL-6, circulating tumor 
DNA, and tissue biomarkers of resistance to chemotherapy and outcome will be 
explored. Finally, the study will include measures of frailty (G8, modified G8, 
and chair-stand-test) to assess whether scoring would enable a personalized 
allocation to different treatments or indicates a possibility for interventions.
DISCUSSION: Single-drug treatment with Gem has for frail patients with 
non-resectable PC been the main treatment option for more than thirty years, but 
the impact on outcome is modest. If improved results and sustained tolerability 
with reduced dose combination chemotherapy can be shown, this could change the 
future practice for this increasing group of patients.

various psychiatric and medical conditions, most studies to date have been 
conducted in research ascertained populations. We aimed to identify the 
psychiatric and physical conditions associated with autism PGS in a health care 
setting.
METHODS: We computed PGS for 12,383 unrelated participants of African genetic 
ancestry (AF) and 65,363 unrelated participants of European genetic ancestry 
(EU) from Vanderbilt's de-identified biobank. Next, we performed phenome wide 
association studies of the autism PGS within these two genetic ancestries.
RESULTS: Seven associations surpassed the Bonferroni adjusted threshold for 
statistical significance (p = 0.05/1374 = 3.6 × 10-5) in the EU participants, 
including mood disorders (OR (95%CI) = 1.08(1.05 to 1.10), p = 1.0 × 10-10), 
autism (OR (95%CI) = 1.34(1.24 to 1.43), p = 1.2 × 10-9), and breast cancer (OR 
(95%CI) = 1.09(1.05 to 1.14), 2.6 × 10-5). There was no statistical evidence for 
PGS-phenotype associations in the AF participants. Conditioning on the diagnosis 
of autism or on median body mass index (BMI) did not impact the strength of the 
reported associations. Although we observed some sex differences in the pattern 
of associations, there was no significant interaction between sex and autism 
PGS. Finally, the associations between autism PGS and autism diagnosis were 
stronger in childhood and adolescence, while the associations with mood 
disorders and breast cancer were stronger in adulthood.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that autism PGS is not only related to autism 
diagnosis but may also be related to adult-onset conditions, including mood 
disorders and some cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study raises the hypothesis that genes associated with autism 
may also increase the risk for cancers later in life. Future studies are 
necessary to replicate and extend our findings.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s11689-023-09485-x

little is known regarding its relationship with the risk of cancer-related 
premature death and long-term sick leave (LTSL), which can lead to a substantial 
loss in working years. The present study aimed to quantify the all-site and 
site-specific associations between MetS and the risk of severe cancer events (a 
composite outcome of LTSL and mortality due to cancer) in a large working 
population in Japan.
METHODS: We recruited 70,875 workers (59,950 men and 10,925 women), aged 20-59 
years, who attended health check-ups in 2011 (10 companies) and 2014 (2 
companies). All workers underwent follow up for severe cancer events until March 
31, 2020. MetS was defined in accordance with the Joint Interim Statement. Cox 
regression models were used to quantify the association between baseline MetS 
and severe cancer events.
RESULTS: During 427,379 person-years of follow-up, 523 participants experienced 
the outcome consisting of 493 LTSLs of which 124 eventually resulted in death, 
and 30 deaths without taking LTSL. The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% 
confidence intervals [CI]) for composite severe events due to all-site, 
obesity-related, and non-obesity-related cancer among those with vs. without 
MetS were 1.26 (1.03, 1.55), 1.37 (1.04, 1.82), and 1.15 (0.84, 1.56), 
respectively. In cancer site-specific analyses, MetS was associated with an 
increased risk of severe events due to pancreatic cancer (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 
0.99-4.26). When mortality was treated solely as the endpoint, the association 
was significant for all-site (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.10-2.26), and obesity-related 
(HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.00-2.54) cancer. Additionally, a greater number of MetS 
components was associated with a greater risk of both severe cancer events and 
cancer-related mortality (P trend < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Among Japanese workers, MetS was associated with an increased risk 
of severe cancer events, especially those due to obesity-linked cancer.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-11026-7

cutaneous melanoma represents approximately 4% of incidental cancers and 1.2% of 
cancer related deaths. In locally advanced (stage III) or resectable metastatic 
(stage IV) melanomas, medical adjuvant treatment is proposed and recent advances 
had shown the benefit of anti-PD1/PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy as well as 
anti-BRAF and anti-MEK targeted therapy in BRAF V600 mutated tumors. However, 
the recurence rate at one year is approximately 30% and justify extensive 
research of predictive biomarkers. If in metastatic disease, the follow-up of 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been demonstrated, its interest in adjuvant 
setting remains to be precised, especially because of a lower detection rate. 
Further, the definition of a molecular response could prove useful to 
personalized treatment.
METHODS: PERCIMEL is an open prospective multicentric study executed through 
collaboration of the Institut de Cancérologie de Lorraine (non-profit 
comprehensive cancer center) and 6 French university and community hospitals. A 
total of 165 patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma, eligible to 
adjuvant imunotherapy or anti-BRAF/MEK kinase inhibitors will be included. The 
primary endpoint is the presence of ctDNA, 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, defined 
as mutated ctDNA copy number calculated as the allelic fraction of a clonal 
mutation relative to total ctDNA. Secondary endpoints are recurrence-free 
survival, distant metastasis-free survival and specific survival. We will follow 
ctDNA along treatment, quantitatively through ctDNA mutated copy number 
variation, qualitatively through the presence of cfDNA and its clonal evolution. 
Relative and absolute variations of ctDNA during follow-up will be also 
analyzed. PERCIMEL study aims at provide scientific evidence that ctDNA 
quantitative and qualitative variations can be used to predict the recurrence of 
patients with melanoma treated with adjuvant immunotherapy or kinase inhibitors, 
thus defining the notion of molecular recurrence.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-11029-4

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is amongst one of the most commonly occurring cancers 
affecting women, and the leading cause of gynecologic related cancer death. Its 
poor prognosis and high mortality rates can be attributed to the absence of 
specific signs and symptoms until advance stages, which frequently leads to late 
diagnosis. Survival rate of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer can be used 
in order to better assess current standard of care; the aim of this study is to 
evaluate the survival rate of ovarian cancer patients in Asia.
METHODS: Systematic review was performed on articles that were published by the 
end of August 2021 in five international databases, including Medline / PubMed, 
ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. The Newcastle-Ottawa 
quality evaluation form was used for cohort studies to evaluate the quality of 
the articles. The Cochran-Q and I2 tests were used to calculate the 
heterogeneity of the studies. The Meta-regression analysis was also done 
according to when the study was published.
RESULTS: A total of 667 articles were reviewed, from which 108 were included in 
this study because they passed the criteria. Based on a randomized model, the 
survival rates of ovarian cancer after 1, 3 and 5 years were respectively 73.65% 
(95% CI, 68.66-78.64), 61.31% (95% CI, 55.39-67.23) and 59.60% (95% CI, 
56.06-63.13). Additionally, based on meta-regression analysis, there was no 
relationship between the year of study and survival rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year survival rate was higher than that of 3- and 5-year for 
ovarian cancer. This study provides invaluable information that can not only 
help establish better standard of care for treatment of ovarian cancer, but also 
assist in development of superior health interventions for prevention and 
treatment of the disease.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-11041-8

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatment patterns for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) in recent years. Therefore, the identification 
of predictive biomarkers has important clinical implications.
METHODS: We collected medical records from 117 aHCC patients treated with 
anti-PD-1 antibody. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression 
were used to evaluate the association between peripheral blood biomarkers and 
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Finally, the 
prognostic nomogram was constructed.
RESULTS: The mPFS and mOS were 7.0 months and 18.7 months, respectively. 
According to Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis, we regarded the 
treatment regimen (p = 0.020), hemoglobin (Hb) at 6-week (p = 0.042), 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at 6-week (p < 0.001), system immune 
inflammation index (SII) at 6-week (p = 0.125) as predictors of PFS, and alpha 
fetoprotein (AFP) (p = 0.035), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (p = 0.012), 
Hb at 6-week (p = 0.010) and NLR at 6-week (p = 0.020) as predictors of OS. 
Furthermore, the results suggest that the OS and PFS nomogram model were in 
agreement with actual observations.
CONCLUSION: Biomarkers in peripheral blood can predict the prognosis of patients

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming is a critical event for cell fate and 
function, making it an attractive target for clinical therapy. The function of 
metabolic reprogramming in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-infected gastric 
intestinal metaplasia remained to be identified.
METHODS: Xanthurenic acid (XA) was measured in gastric cancer cells treated with 
H. pylori or H. pylori virulence factor, respectively, and qPCR and WB were 
performed to detect CDX2 and key metabolic enzymes expression. A subcellular 
fractionation approach, luciferase and ChIP combined with immunofluorescence 
were applied to reveal the mechanism underlying H. pylori mediated kynurenine 
pathway in intestinal metaplasia in vivo and in vitro.
RESULTS: Herein, we, for the first time, demonstrated that H. pylori contributed 
to gastric intestinal metaplasia characterized by enhanced Caudal-related 
homeobox transcription factor-2 (CDX2) and mucin2 (MUC2) expression, which was 
attributed to activation of kynurenine pathway. H. pylori promoted kynurenine 
aminotransferase II (KAT2)-mediated kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, 
leading to XA production, which further induced CDX2 expression in gastric 
epithelial cells. Mechanically, H. pylori activated cyclic guanylate adenylate 
synthase (cGAS)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway in gastric 
epithelial cells, leading to enhance IRF3 nuclear translocation and the binding 
of IRF3 to KAT2 promoter. Inhibition of KAT2 could significantly reverse the 
effect of H. pylori on CDX2 expression. Also, the rescue phenomenon was observed 
in gastric epithelial cells treated with H. pylori after IRF3 inhibition in 
vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, phospho-IRF3 was confirmed to be a clinical 
positive relationship with CDX2.
CONCLUSION: These finding suggested H. pylori contributed to gastric intestinal 
metaplasia through KAT2-mediated kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism via 
cGAS-IRF3 signaling, targeting the kynurenine pathway could be a promising 
strategy to prevent gastric intestinal metaplasia caused by H. pylori infection.

while impaired expression of miR-5195-3p in HepG2 cells resulted in the opposite 
effects. Bioinformatics prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene assays 
proved that SOX9 and TPM4 were the target genes of miR-5195-3p in hepatoma 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR-5195-3p plays a 
critical role in insulin-resistant hepatoma cells and might be a potential

are still not promising despite recent breakthroughs in treatment. Endoplasmic 
reticulum stress (ERS) is a self-protective mechanism resulting from an 
imbalance in quality control of unfolded proteins when cells are stressed, which 
plays an active role in lung cancer development, but the relationship between 
ERS and the pathological characteristics and clinical prognosis of LUAD patients 
remains unclear.
METHODS: LASSO and Cox regression were applied based on sequencing information 
to construct the model, which was validated to be robust. The risk scores of the 
patients were calculated using the formula provided by the model, and the 
patients were divided into high and low-risk groups according to the median 
cut-off of risk scores. Cox regression analysis identifies independent 
prognostic factors for these patients, and enrichment analysis of 
prognosis-related genes was also performed. The relationship between risk scores 
and tumor mutation burden (TMB), cancer stem cell index, and drug sensitivity 
was explored.
RESULTS: We constructed a 13-gene prognostic model for LUAD patients. Patients 
in the high-risk group had worse overall survival, lower immune score and 
ESTIMATE score, higher TMB, higher cancer stem cell index, and higher 
sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, we constructed 
a nomogram that predicts 5-year survival in LUAD patients, which helps 
clinicians to foresee the prognosis from a new perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the association of ERS with LUAD and the 
potential use of ERS in guiding treatment.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12859-023-05384-z

occurs when NF1 gene variants result in loss of neurofibromin, a negative 
regulator of RAS activity. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are peripheral nerve 
sheath tumors that develop in patients with NF1 and are associated with 
substantial morbidity and for which, until recently, the only treatment was 
surgical resection. However, surgery carries several risks and a proportion of 
PN are considered inoperable. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of PN led 
to the investigation of targeted therapies as medical treatment options, and the 
MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib has shown promising efficacy in pediatric patients 
with NF1 and symptomatic, inoperable PN. In a phase I/II trial, most children 
(approximately 70%) achieved reduction in tumor volume accompanied by 
improvements in patient-reported outcomes (decreased tumor-related pain and 
improvements in quality of life, strength, and range of motion). Selumetinib is 
currently the only licensed medical therapy indicated for use in pediatric 
patients with symptomatic, inoperable NF1-PN, with approval based on the results 
of this pivotal clinical study. Several other MEK inhibitors (binimetinib, 
mirdametinib, trametinib) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib are 
also being investigated as medical therapies for NF1-PN. Careful consideration 
of multiple aspects of both disease and treatments is vital to reduce morbidity 
and improve outcomes in patients with this complex and heterogeneous disease, 
and clinicians should be fully aware of the risks and benefits of available 
treatments. There is no single treatment pathway for patients with NF1-PN; 
surgery, watchful waiting, and/or medical treatment are options. Treatment 
should be individualized based on recommendations from a multidisciplinary team, 
considering the size and location of PN, effects on adjacent tissues, and 
patient and family preferences. This review outlines the treatment strategies 
currently available for patients with NF1-PN and the evidence supporting the use

uterine-confined, with a high 5-year survival rate. However, a small subset of 
women with low-grade and early-stage endometrioid endometrial cancer experience 
recurrence and death; thus, a more precise risk-stratification is needed.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old woman presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding 
and was diagnosed with FIGO grade 1 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma by 
curettage. Comprehensive cancer staging including pelvic and para-aortic 
lymphadenectomy was then performed. Postoperative pathological findings 
suggested an FIGO grade 1 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma infiltrating the 
superficial muscle layer. The patient did not receive adjuvant therapy. After 
4 years of follow-up, the patient returned to our institution with lung 
metastasis. She underwent thoracoscopic resection of the affected lobes, 
followed by six cycles of combined chemotherapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin. 
Next-generation sequencing showed that the primary and lung metastatic tumors 
shared 4 mutations: PTEN (p.P248Lfs*8), CTNNB1 (p.D32A), BCOR (p.N1425S) and CBL 
(p.S439N). Immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear location of β-catenin in the 
primary and lung metastatic tumor samples, indicating abnormal activation of 
β-catenin.

Beliefs about risk are instrumental in motivating many health protective 
behaviours, but there may be confusion around which behaviour is appropriate to 
detect breast cancer earlier. Breast awareness, defined as an understanding of 
how the breasts look and feel so changes can be identified early, is widely 
recommended. In contrast, breast self-examination involves palpation using a 
specified method. We aimed to investigate young women's beliefs about their risk 
and experiences of breast awareness.
METHODS: Thirty-seven women aged 30-39 years residing in a North West region of 
England with no family or personal history of breast cancer participated in 
seven focus groups (n = 29) and eight individual interviews. Data were analysed 
using reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Three themes were generated. ""Future me's problem"" describes why women 
perceive breast cancer as an older woman's disease. Uncertainty regarding 
checking behaviours highlights how confusion about self-checking behaviour 
advice has resulted in women infrequently performing breast checks. Campaigns as 
a missed opportunity highlights the potential negative effects of current breast 
cancer fundraising campaigns and the perceived absence of educational 
campaigning about breast cancer for this demographic.
CONCLUSIONS: Young women expressed low perceived susceptibility to developing 
breast cancer in the near future. Women did not know what breast self-checking 
behaviours they should be performing and expressed a lack of confidence in how 
to perform a breast check appropriately due to limited knowledge about what to 
look and feel for. Consequently, women reported disengagement with breast 
awareness. Defining and clearly communicating the best strategy for breast 
awareness and establishing whether it is beneficial or not are essential next 
steps.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12905-023-02441-w

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Management of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) can be 
challenging in gastric cancer patients undergoing radical gastrectomy and is 
always associated with poor prognosis. Even though oncology nurse navigator 
(ONN) provide effective and critical individualized care to patients, little is 
known about their impact on the occurrence of PPCs in gastric cancer patients. 
This study aimed to determine whether ONN decreases the incidence of PPCs in 
gastric cancer patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review in which data for gastric cancer 
patients at one centre was evaluated before and after an ONN hired. An ONN was 
introduced to patients at their initial visit to manage pulmonary complications 
throughout treatment. The research was conducted from 1 August 2020 to 31 
January 2022. The study participants were divided into the non-ONN group (from 1 
August 2020 to 31 January 2021) and the ONN group (from 1 August 2021 to 31 
January 2022). The incidence and severity of PPCs between the groups were then 
compared.
RESULTS: ONN significantly decreased the incidence of PPCs (15.0% vs. 9.8%) 
(OR = 2.532(95% CI: 1.087-3.378, P = 0.045)), but there was no significant 
difference in the components of PPCs including pleural effusion, atelectasis, 
respiratory infection, and pneumothorax. The severity of PPCs was also 
significantly higher in the non-ONN group (p = 0.020). No significant 
statistical difference was observed for the major pulmonary complications 
([Formula: see text] 3) between the two groups (p = 0.286).

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Peritoneal metastasis is one of the main causes of death in patients 
with gastric cancer (GC). Galectin-1 regulates various undesirable biological 
behaviors in GC and may be key in GC peritoneal metastasis.
METHODS: In this study, we elucidated the regulatory role of galectin-1 in GC 
cell peritoneal metastasis. GC and peritoneal tissues underwent 
hematoxylin-eosin (HE), immunohistochemical (IHC), and Masson trichrome staining 
to analyze the difference in galectin-1 expression and peritoneal collagen 
deposition in different GC clinical stages. The regulatory role of galectin-1 in 
GC cell adhesion to mesenchymal cells and in collagen expression was determined 
using HMrSV5 human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). Collagen and 
corresponding mRNA expression were detected with western blotting and reverse 
transcription PCR, respectively. The promoting effect of galectin-1 on GC 
peritoneal metastasis was verified in vivo. Collagen deposition and collagen I, 
collagen III, and fibronectin 1 (FN1) expression in the peritoneum of the animal 
models were detected by Masson trichrome and IHC staining.
RESULTS: Galectin-1 and collagen deposition in the peritoneal tissues was 
correlated with GC clinical staging and were positively correlated. Galectin-1 
enhanced the ability of GC cells to adhere to the HMrSV5 cells by promoting 
collagen I, collagen III, and FN1 expression. The in vivo experiments confirmed 
that galectin-1 promoted GC peritoneal metastasis by promoting peritoneal 
collagen deposition.
CONCLUSION: Galectin-1-induced peritoneal fibrosis may create a favorable 
environment for GC cell peritoneal metastasis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-11047-2

disease or chronic hepatitis B infection. Among high-risk patients, surveillance 
for HCC every 6 months is recommended by international guidelines. However, 
rates of HCC surveillance are suboptimal (11-64%). Barriers at the patient, 
provider, and healthcare delivery system levels have been identified.
METHODS: We performed a systemic scoping review to identify and characterize 
interventions to improve HCC surveillance that has previously been evaluated. 
Searches using key terms in PubMed and Embase were performed to identify studies 
examining interventions designed to improve the surveillance rate for HCC in 
patients with cirrhosis or chronic liver disease that were published in English 
between January 1990 and September 2021.
RESULTS: Included studies (14) had the following study designs: (1) randomized 
clinical trials (3, 21.4%), (2) quasi-experimental (2, 14.3%), (3) prospective 
cohort (6, 42.8%), and (4) retrospective cohort (3, 21.4%). Interventions 
included mailed outreach invitations, nursing outreach, patient education with 
or without printed materials, provider education, patient navigation, chronic 
disease management programs, nursing-led protocols for image ordering, automated 
reminders to physicians and nurses, web-based clinical management tools, HCC 
surveillance databases, provider compliance reports, radiology-led surveillance 
programs, subsidized HCC surveillance, and the use of oral medications. It was 
found that HCC surveillance rates increased after intervention implementation in 
all studies.
CONCLUSION: Despite improvements in HCC surveillance rates with intervention, 
compliance remained suboptimal. Further analysis of which interventions yield 
the greatest increases in HCC surveillance, design of multi-pronged strategies, 
and improved implementation are needed.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

the grafts. There has been a decade of research in cryopreservation-induced 
oxidative stress in single cells with significant successes in mitigating this 
major source of loss of viability. However, despite its success elsewhere and 
beyond a few promising experiments, little attention has been paid to this key 
aspect of OTCT-induced damage. As more and more clinical practices adopt OTCT 
for fertility preservation, it is a critical time to review oxidative stress as 
a cause of damage and to outline potential ameliorative interventions. Here we 
give an overview of the application of OTCT for female fertility preservation 
and existing challenges; clarify the potential contribution of oxidative stress 
in ovarian follicle loss; and highlight potential ability of antioxidant 
treatments to mitigate the OTCT-induced injuries that might be of interest to 
cryobiologists and reproductive clinicians.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

at least as follows; overall survival, progression-free survival, grade ≥ 3 
cardiopulmonary toxicities, dose-volume histograms, or lymphopenia or absolute 
lymphocyte counts (ALCs) in esophageal cancer patients treated with PBT or 
photon-based RT. Of 286 selected studies, 23 including 1 randomized control 
study, 2 propensity matched analyses, and 20 cohort studies were eligible for 
qualitative review. Overall survival and progression-free survival were better 
after PBT than after photon-based RT, but the difference was significant in only 
one of seven studies. The rate of grade 3 cardiopulmonary toxicities was lower 
after PBT (0-13%) than after photon-based RT (7.1-30.3%). Dose-volume histograms 
revealed better results for PBT than photon-based RT. Three of four reports 
evaluating the ALC demonstrated a significantly higher ALC after PBT than after 
photon-based RT. Our review found that PBT resulted in a favorable trend in the 
survival rate and had an excellent dose distribution, contributing to reduced 
cardiopulmonary toxicities and a maintained number of lymphocytes. These results

postpone second transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) after BCG 
induction in selected patients. We aimed to evaluate the oncological outcomes of 
postponed TURBT and the potential to replace second TURBT by routine cystoscopy 
and cytology.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective analysis of patients with TaG3/high 
grade (HG) or T1HG urothelial bladder cancer was performed. All patients 
underwent a complete TURBT between 2000 and 2013 with presence of detrusor 
muscle, full BCG induction and routine cystoscopy and cytology, followed by a 
second TURBT. Results of the cystoscopy, cytology and pathology reports of the 
TURBT were analyzed by descriptive characteristics, sensitivity, specificity, 
negative and positive predictive values, as well as survival analyses.
RESULTS: 112 patients were included. Residual tumour was present at second TURBT 
in 21.4%. Upstaging rate from pTaHG to pT1HG and pT1HG to pT2 was 0% and 2.7%, 
respectively. pT0 was confirmed in 79% of patients, but in 98% of patients with 
combined negative cytology and cystoscopy after BCG. With a median follow-up of 
109 months, the 3-year OS was 85%, RFS 74% and PFS 89%. Sensitivity, 
specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of 
cystoscopy and urinary cytology for the presence of residual tumour were 92%, 
97%, 98% and 85%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study underpins the recommendation of the EAU NMIBC guideline 
panel that, if needed and in selected patients, second TURBT may be postponed 
until after BCG induction treatment in pT1HG disease. Also, routine second TURBT 
can be omitted in pTaHG disease. Data on replacing second TURBT after BCG 
treatment by routine cystoscopy and cytology appear promising but require 
further confirmation in prospective studies.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

acid as a drug with diphenylalanine peptide nanohole as an efficient nanodrug 
delivery system was investigated computationally. It focuses on the structural 
properties, drug loading capacity in the carrier, intermolecular interactions, 
and drug encapsulation behaviors. The results show that the average number of 
hydrogen bonds between diphenylalanine and folic acid will increase when the 
system reaches equilibrium. In addition, by increasing the weight concentration 
of folic acid from 0.3 to 0.9%, the number of hydrogen bond between them 
increases about 18%. In other words, hydrogen bonding can play an effective role 
in the binding of folic acid to the drug carrier. The results of the radial 
distribution function of water molecules around the carrier mass center show 
that its effective radius is around 1.2 nm (or 12 Å), which is in a good 
agreement with the results obtained from the hydrodynamic radius.
METHOD: The initial structures were optimized in Amber molecular mechanics using 
Gaussian 09 software in aqueous medium in DFT/B3LYP/6-31 g(d). The molecular 
structure of folic acid was obtained from the PubChem database. The initial 
parameters are embedded in AmberTools. To calculate partial charges, restrained 
electrostatic potential (RESP) method was used. Gromacs 2021 software, modified 
water model (SPC/E), and Amber 03 force field have been used in all simulations.

atrophic lesions and their histopathological characteristics.
METHODS: Histopathological diagnosis and immunohistochemical staining using the 
EnVision two-step method were conducted on 1969 gastric mucosal atrophic lesions 
obtained from gastroscopic biopsy specimens. A total of 48-month three-stage 
endoscopic biopsy follow-ups were performed.
RESULTS: When the gastric mucosal epithelium was affected by infection, chemical 
irritation, or immune or genetic factors, the gastric mucosal epithelium glands 
atrophied, the mucosa became thinner, the number of glands decreased, the 
intestinal epithelium progressed to metaplasia and smooth muscle fibre became 
hyperplasia. Such changes may lead to the proliferation and dysplasia of 
epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa and neoplastic hyperplasia in nature; 
this is referred to as gastric mucosal atrophic lesions in this study. According 
to this definition, the present study divided gastric mucosal atrophy into four 
types: (1) glandular atrophy of the lamina propria; (2) compensatory 
proliferative atrophy; (3) intestinal metaplasia atrophy; and (4) smooth muscle 
proliferative atrophy. The incidence rates of the above were 40.1% (789/1969), 
14.3% (281/1969), 27.8% (547/1969) and 17.9% (352/1969), respectively. One- to 
4-year follow-ups found that the changes were not significant and that the 
percentages of patients with disease exacerbation were 85.7% (1688/1969) and 
9.8% (192/1969). The percentages of patients who developed low-grade 
intraepithelial neoplasia and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia were 2.8% 
(55/1969) and 1.1% (21/1969), respectively; 0.7% (13/1969) of patients developed 
intramucosal cancer.
CONCLUSION: Gastric mucosal atrophic lesions and histopathological staging are 
based on the morphological characteristics of gastric mucosal atrophy and the 
hypothesis of malignant transformation of cells during the occurrence and 
development of mucosal atrophy. Mastering pathological staging is beneficial to 
clinicians for enacting precise treatment and is important for reducing the 
incidence of gastric cancer.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10120-023-01400-6

post-gastrectomy outcomes in gastric cancer patients, this study aimed to 
investigate the impact of antithrombotic drugs on postoperative outcomes in 
these patients after gastrectomy.
METHODS: Patients with Stage I-III primary gastric cancer who underwent radical 
gastrectomy between April 2005 and May 2022 were included. We performed 
propensity score matching to adjust for patient background and compared bleeding 
complications. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression analysis was 
performed to identify risk factors associated with bleeding complications.
RESULTS: Of the 6798 patients, 310 (4.6%) were in the antithrombotic group and 
6488 (95.4%) were in the non-antithrombotic group. Twenty-six patients (0.38%) 
experienced bleeding complications. After matching, the number of patients in 
each group was 300, with insignificant differences in any factor. A comparison 
of postoperative outcomes showed no difference in bleeding complications 
(P = 0.249). In the antithrombotic group, 39 (12.6%) continued drugs, and 271 
(87.4%) discontinued them before surgery. After matching, there were 30 and 60 
patients, respectively, with no differences in patient background. A comparison 
of postoperative outcomes showed no differences in bleeding complications 
(P = 0.551). In multivariate analysis, antithrombotic drug use and continuation 
of antiplatelet agents were not risk factors for bleeding complications.
CONCLUSION: Antithrombotic drugs and its continuation may not worsen bleeding 
complications in patients with gastric cancer after radical gastrectomy. 
Bleeding complications were rare, and further studies are needed on risk factors 
for bleeding complications in larger databases.","© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The International Gastric

via five aspects, including autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
lysosomal biogenesis, lipid metabolism, and oncogenic signaling pathways; on the

compared to monotherapies and, to some degree, combination therapies. Our 
results suggest that targeting both PD-1 and B7-H3 with BsAbs increases their 
specificities to B7-H3 and PD-L1 double-positive tumors and induces a synergetic 
effect. We conclude that B7-H3×PD-L1 BsAb is favored over mAbs and possibly 
combination therapies in treating B7-H3 and PD-L1 double-positive tumors.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shanghai Institute of Materia

failure. Mitochondria are essential for cardiomyocyte homeostasis, as disruption 
of mitochondrial dynamics enhances mitophagy and apoptosis. However, therapies 
targeted to improve mitochondrial function in septic patients have not been 
explored. Transcriptomic data analysis revealed that the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway in the heart was the 
most significantly decreased in the cecal ligation puncture-treated mouse heart 
model, and PPARα was the most notably decreased among the three PPAR family 
members. Male Pparafl/fl (wild-type), cardiomyocyte-specific Ppara-deficient 
(PparaΔCM), and myeloid-specific Ppara-deficient (PparaΔMac) mice were injected 
intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce endotoxic cardiac 
dysfunction. PPARα signaling was decreased in LPS-treated wild-type mouse 
hearts. To determine the cell type in which PPARα signaling was suppressed, the 
cell type-specific Ppara-null mice were examined. Cardiomyocyte- but not 
myeloid-specific Ppara deficiency resulted in exacerbated LPS-induced cardiac 
dysfunction. Ppara disruption in cardiomyocytes augmented mitochondrial 
dysfunction, as revealed by damaged mitochondria, lowered ATP contents, 
decreased mitochondrial complex activities, and increased DRP1/MFN1 protein 
levels. RNA sequencing results further showed that cardiomyocyte Ppara 
deficiency potentiated the impairment of fatty acid metabolism in LPS-treated 
heart tissue. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics resulted in increased 
mitophagy and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in Ppara△CM mice. Moreover, 
mitochondrial dysfunction caused an increase of reactive oxygen species, leading 
to increased IL-6/STAT3/NF-κB signaling. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagosome 
formation inhibitor) alleviated cardiomyocyte Ppara disruption-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy. Finally, pre-treatment with the 
PPARα agonist WY14643 lowered mitochondrial dysfunction-induced cardiomyopathy 
in hearts from LPS-treated mice. Thus, cardiomyocyte but not myeloid PPARα 
protects against septic cardiomyopathy by improving fatty acid metabolism and 
mitochondrial dysfunction, thus highlighting that cardiomyocyte PPARα may be a 
therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac disease.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shanghai Institute of Materia

revolutionized the clinical management of many types of cancers. However, 
long-term durable tumour control is only achieved in a fraction of patients who 
receive these therapies. Understanding the mechanisms underlying clinical 
response and resistance to treatment is therefore essential to expanding the 
level of clinical benefit obtained from immunotherapies. In this Review, we 
describe the molecular mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation in 
tumours and their clinical consequences. We examine how various aspects of the 
antigen-presentation machinery (APM) shape tumour immunity. In particular, we 
discuss genomic variants in HLA alleles and other APM components, highlighting 
their influence on the immunopeptidomes of both malignant cells and immune 
cells. Understanding the APM, how it is regulated and how it changes in tumour 
cells is crucial for determining which patients will respond to immunotherapy 
and why some patients develop resistance. We focus on recently discovered 
molecular and genomic alterations that drive the clinical outcomes of patients 
receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors. An improved understanding of how these 
variables mediate tumour-immune interactions is expected to guide the more 
precise administration of immunotherapies and reveal potentially promising 
directions for the development of new immunotherapeutic approaches.",© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.,"DOI: 10.1038/s41571-023-00789-4

composed of stromal cells with a monotonous appearance, macrophages, and 
osteoclast-like giant cells. GCTB is commonly associated with a pathogenic 
mutation in the H3-3A gene. While complete surgical resection is the standard 
cure for GCTB, it often results in local recurrence and, rarely, metastasis. 
Thus, an effective multidisciplinary treatment approach is necessary. Although 
patient-derived cell lines is an essential tool for investigating novel 
treatment strategies, there are only four GCTB cell lines available in public 
cell banks. Therefore, this study aimed to establish novel GCTB cell lines and 
successfully created NCC-GCTB6-C1 and NCC-GCTB7-C1 cell lines from two patients' 
surgically removed tumor tissues. These cell lines exhibited H3-3A gene 
mutations, consistent proliferation, and invasive properties. After 
characterizing their behaviors, we performed high-throughput screening of 214 
anti-cancer drugs for NCC-GCTB6-C1 and NCC-GCTB7-C1 and integrated their 
screening data with those of NCC-GCTB1-C1, NCC-GCTB2-C1, NCC-GCTB3-C1, 
NCC-GCTB4-C1, and NCC-GCTB5-C1 that we previously established. We identified

landscape in multiple myeloma (MM). The addition of these agents has 
significantly improved patient outcomes; however, MM remains largely incurable, 
with heavily pretreated patients suffering from shorter survival times. To 
address this unmet need, the focus has shifted toward novel mode of action 
therapies, such as bispecific antibodies (BsAb), which simultaneously bind to 
immune effector cells and myeloma cells. Currently, there are several T 
cell-redirecting BsAb being developed that target BCMA, GPRC5D, and FcRH5. These 
BsAb show impressive clinical activity for the relapsed/refractory population 
targeted and will likely become an essential part of MM treatment protocols in 
the future. In this podcast, the authors summarize and highlight some of the T 
cell-redirecting BsAb currently in development for the treatment of 
relapsed/refractory MM with a focus on the data reported at the oral session for 
BsAb at the American Society of Hematology's 2022 meeting from clinical phase 1

data for the BsAb: talquetamab, elranatamab, teclistamab, forimtamig, and 
alnuctamab.","Plain Language Summary: Multiple myeloma is a type of bone marrow cancer. It 
affects a type of white blood cell known as a plasma cell. Although multiple 
myeloma cannot be cured with current therapies, it can often be controlled with 
treatment. In some people with multiple myeloma, the treatment does not work at 
all, or it works at first but the cancer comes back. This is known as refractory 
or relapsed multiple myeloma. New types of treatment are needed for these 
people.Researchers are studying a type of antibody made in a laboratory called a 
bispecific antibody. They are a new type of treatment for multiple myeloma that 
work in a different way to existing treatments. This means they may help people 
who earlier treatments did not work well for. Bispecific antibodies use the 
body’s immune system to kill cancer cells. They work by attaching to two 
different types of proteins: one found on plasma cells, and another on a type of 
white blood cell called a T cell.At the American Society of Hematology’s 2022 
meeting, researchers presented results from clinical trials studying five 
different bispecific antibodies: talquetamab, elranatamab, teclistamab, 
forimtamig, and alnuctamab. In this podcast, two healthcare professionals 
summarize the most common side effects people had while taking these new 
medicines, and how manageable they were. They also discuss how effective these 
bispecific antibodies were at treating refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s12325-023-02551-9

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: We investigated whether uptake of [18F] AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 on positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) could predict treatment 
response and survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 47 patients with histopathologically 
confirmed primary PDAC who provided pretreatment [18F] AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 scans to 
detect fibroblast activation protein (FAP) on the tumor surface by uptake of 
[18F] AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04. PDAC specimens were immunohistochemically stained with 
cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) markers. We obtained a second PET scan after 
one cycle of chemotherapy to study changes in FAPI uptake variables from before 
to during treatment. Correlations between baseline PET variables and CAF-related 
immunohistochemical markers were assessed with Spearman's rank test. Cox 
regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess relationships between 
disease progression and potential predictors. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis was used to define the optimal cut-off points for 
distinguishing patients according to good response vs. poor response per RECIST 
v.1.1.
RESULTS: The FAPI PET variables maximum and mean standardized uptake values 
(SUVmax, SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion FAP expression 
(TLF) were positively correlated with CAF markers (FAP, α-smooth muscle actin, 
vimentin, S100A4, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α/β, all 
P < 0.05). MTV was associated with survival in patients with inoperable PDAC 
(all P < 0.05). Cox multivariate regression showed that MTV was associated with 
overall survival (MTV hazard ratio [HR] = 1.016, P = 0.016). Greater changes 
from before to during chemotherapy in SUVmax, MTV, and TLF were associated with 
good treatment response (all P < 0.05). ΔMTV, ΔTLF, and ΔSUVmax had larger areas 
under the curve than ΔCA19-9 for predicting treatment response. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis showed that the extent of change in MTV and TLF from before to after 
treatment predicted progression-free survival, with cut-off values (based on 
medians) of - 4.95 for ΔMTV (HR = 8.09, P = 0.013) and - 77.83 for ΔTLF 
(HR = 4.62, P = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher baseline MTV on [18F] AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 scans was 
associated with poorer survival in patients with inoperable PDAC. ΔMTV was more 
sensitive for predicting response than ΔCA19-9. These results are clinically 
meaningful for identifying patients with PDAC who are at high risk of disease 
progression.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

imaging (bp-MRI) in predicting detrusor muscle invasion for bladder cancer (BC) 
located at the ureteral orifice by comparing it with the Vesical Imaging 
Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) system based on multiparametric MRI 
(mp-MRI).
METHODS: Patients with histopathologically proven BC located at the ureteral 
orifice from December 2019 to November 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. Two 
sets, bp-MRI (set 1) and mp-MRI (set 2), were formed from the images. Both sets 
were evaluated independent of histopathology by three radiologists with 
different levels of experience in abdominal radiology. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic 
performance of VI-RADS in the prediction of muscle invasion. The intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate inter-reader agreement.
RESULTS: Of 68 patients with BCs located at the ureteral orifice, 50 (48 males, 
median age: 72 years) met the study criteria. Out of the 50 patients, 36 had 
non-muscle invasive BC (pTa-T1) and 14 had muscle invasive BC (MIBC) (pT2-T4). 
In the comparison of VI-RADS categories with histopathologic data for MIBC 
detection, the area under the curve of the ROC analysis for the bp- and mp-MRI 
protocol was 1.000-0.986 for reader 1, 0.893-0.901 for reader 2, and 0.808-0.865 
for reader 3. There was no statistically significant difference in predicting 
detrusor muscle invasion with the bp- and mp-MRI-based on VI-RADS categories for 
all readers (p = 0.126, 0.203, and 0.322, respectively). The ICCs between all 
the readers showed excellent agreement and were similar for both protocols.
CONCLUSION: The bp-MRI consisting of DWI and T2-WI can be used as an alternative 
to the mp-MRI in predicting detrusor muscle invasion for BCs located at the 
ureteral orifice; however, less experienced readers should exercise caution.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

recruited to the PAZ domain of AGO2 forming a ternary complex containing GRB2,

which are regulated by the binding of GRB2. First, mature and precursor 
transcripts of mir-17~92 and mir-221 miRNAs are enhanced. Second, mature, but 
not precursor, let-7 family miRNAs are diminished suggesting that GRB2 directly

patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy according to preoperative 
computed tomography angiography (CTA) assessment. However, reports of the 
long-term oncological outcomes are still limited.
METHODS: The data of 988 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic or 
robotic radical gastrectomy between January 2014 and September 2018 were 
analyzed retrospectively at our center, and propensity score matching was used 
to eliminate bias. Study cohorts were divided into the CTA group (n = 498) and 
the non-CTA group (n = 490) depending on whether preoperative CTA was available. 
The primary and secondary endpoints were the 3-year overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) rates and the intraoperative course and short-term 
outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: 431 patients were included in each group after PSM. Compared with the 
non-CTA group, the CTA group had more harvested lymph nodes and less operative 
time, blood loss, intraoperative vascular injury and total cost, especially in 
the subgroup analysis with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 patients. There was no difference in 
the 3 year OS and DFS between the CTA group and the non-CTA group. When further 
stratified by BMI < 25 or ≥ 25 kg/m2, the 3-year OS and DFS were significantly 
higher in the CTA group than in the non-CTA group in terms of BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic or robotic radical gastrectomy based on preoperative 
perigastric artery CTA surgical decision-making has the possibility of improving 
short-term outcomes. However, there is no difference in the long-term prognosis, 
except for a subgroup of patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

genes contribute to protection against the establishment of human papilloma 
virus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinoma (CC). The objective of this study was 
to better understand the contribution of inflammasome and its cytokines in the 
CC microenvironment.
METHODS: The inflammasome activation was analyzed in CC tumoral cell lines and 
healthy donors (HD)' monocytes in co-culture. In vitro results were then 
compared to CC patients' public databases.
RESULTS: CC cells did not produce IL-1ß or IL-18 themselves, however, when in 
co-culture with HD monocytes, induced IL-1ß release in those leucocytes. 
Inflammasome activation appears to be partially dependent on the NLRP3 receptor. 
Public data analysis revealed that IL1B expression is increased in the CC 
compared to normal uterine cervix, and that patients with high IL1B expression 
had a shorter overall survival.
CONCLUSION: CC microenvironment can activate the inflammasome and IL-1ß release 
in surrounding monocytes, which could be detrimental for CC prognosis.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Federación de Sociedades

social, stereotypical, and repetitive behaviors. Neural dysregulation was 
proposed as an etiological factor in ASD. The sodium leakage channel (NCA), 
regulated by NLF-1 (NCA localization factor-1), has a major role in maintaining 
the physiological excitatory function of neurons. We aimed to examine the level 
of NLF-1 in ASD children and correlate it with the severity of the disease. We 
examined the plasma levels of NLF-1 in 80 ASD and neurotypical children using 
ELISA. The diagnosis and severity of ASD were based on the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), Childhood 
Autism Rating Score, Social Responsiveness Scale, and Short Sensory Profile. 
Then, we compared the levels of NLF-1 with the severity of the disease and 
behavioral and sensory symptoms. Our results showed a significant decrease in 
the plasma levels of NLF-1 in ASD children compared to neurotypical children 
(p < 0.001). Additionally, NLF-1 was significantly correlated with the severity 
of the behavioral symptoms of ASD (p < 0.05). The low levels of NLF-1 in ASD 
children potentially affect the severity of their behavioral symptoms by 
reducing neuron excitability through NCA. These novel findings open a new venue 
for pharmacological and possible genetic research involving NCA in ASD children.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36953-0

Differences in androgen levels between men and women are considered the main 
causes of incidence rate differences. In this study, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) 
significantly increased the proliferation and invasion of BLCA cells. In 
addition, BLCA formation and metastatic rates were higher in 
N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)-treated male mice than in female 
and castrated male mice in vivo. However, immunohistochemistry showed that 
androgen receptor (AR) was expressed at low levels in normal and BLCA tissues of 
men and women. The classical AR pathway considers that DHT binds to AR and 
induces it to enter the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription factor. 
Here, a non-AR combination pathway of androgen that promoted BLCA development 
was investigated. The EPPK1 protein was bombarded with DHT, as determined by 
biotinylated DHT-binding pull-down experiments. EPPK1 was highly expressed in 
BLCA tissues, and EPPK1 knockdown significantly inhibited BLCA cell 
proliferation and invasion promoted by DHT. Moreover, JUP expression was 
elevated in DHT-treated high-EPPK1 expressing cells, and JUP knockdown inhibited 
cell proliferation and invasion. EPPK1 overexpression increased tumour growth 
and JUP expression in nude mice. Furthermore, DHT increased the expression of 
the MAPK signals p38, p-p38, and c-Jun, and c-Jun could bind to the JUP 
promoter. However, the promotion of p38, p-p38, and c-Jun expression by DHT was 
not observed in EPPK1 knockdown cells, and a p38 inhibitor suppressed the 
DHT-induced effects, indicating that p38 MAPK may be involved in the regulation 
of DHT-dependent EPPK1-JUP-promoted BLCA cell proliferation and invasion. The 
growth of bladder tumours in BBN-treated mice was inhibited by the addition of 
the hormone inhibitor goserelin. Our findings indicated the potential oncogenic 
role and mechanism of DHT in BLCA pathogenesis through a non-AR pathway, which 
may serve as a novel therapeutic target for BLCA.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41419-023-05882-1

study, we intended to explore the prognostic value of TBX15 and its link to 
glioma immune infiltration and examine TBX15 expression in pan-cancer using 
RNAseq data in TPM format from TCGA and GTEx. TBX15 mRNA and protein expressions

and Western blot. The effect of TBX15 on survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier 
Method. The correlation between TBX15 upregulation and the clinicopathological 
characteristics of glioma patients was assessed by using TCGA databases, and the 
relationship between TBX15 and other genes in glioma was evaluated by using TCGA 
data. The top 300 genes most significantly associated with TBX15 were selected 
to establish a PPI network through the STRING database. The relationship between 
TBX15 mRNA expression and immune cell infiltration was explored by using ssGSEA 
and the TIMER Database. It was found that TBX15 mRNA expression in glioma 
tissues was significantly higher than that in the adjacent normal tissues, and 
this difference was most obvious in high-grade gliomas. TBX15 expression was 
increased in human gliomas and associated with worse clinicopathological 
characteristics and poorer survival prognosis in glioma patients. In addition, 
elevated TBX15 expression was linked to a collection of genes involved in 
immunosuppression. In conclusion, TBX15 played an important role in immune cell 
infiltration in glioma and may prove to be a predictor of the prognosis in

due to intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance. In this study, it is identified 
that inhibition of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor 1 can relieve 
tumor fibrosis, thus facilitating the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating T 
lymphocytes. Subsequently, a nanovesicle is constructed for tumor-specific 
co-delivery of a TGF-β inhibitor (LY2157299, LY) and the photosensitizer 
pyropheophorbide a (PPa). The LY-loaded nanovesicles suppress tumor fibrosis to 
promote intratumoral infiltration of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, PPa chelated 
with gadolinium ion is capable of fluorescence, photoacoustic and magnetic 
resonance triple-modal imaging-guided photodynamic therapy, to induce 
immunogenic death of tumor cells and elicit antitumor immunity in preclinical 
cancer models in female mice. These nanovesicles are further armored with a

kinase, is up-regulated and related to poor prognosis in many types of cancers. 
Y-box binding protein 1 (YB1) is a DNA/RNA binding protein and serves important 
roles in multiple cellular processes. Here, we reported that TOPK and YB1 were 
both highly expressed in esophageal cancer (EC) and correlated with poor 
prognosis. TOPK knockout effectively suppressed EC cell proliferation and these 
effects were reversible by rescuing YB1 expression. Notably, TOPK phosphorylated 
YB1 at Thr 89 (T89) and Ser 209 (S209) amino acid residues, then the 
phosphorylated YB1 bound with the promoter of the eukaryotic translation 
elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1) to activate its transcription. 
Consequently, the AKT/mTOR signal pathway was activated by up-regulated eEF1A1 
protein. Importantly, TOPK inhibitor HI-TOPK-032 suppressed the EC cell 
proliferation and tumor growth by TOPK/YB1/eEF1A1 signal pathway in vitro and in 
vivo. Taken together, our study reveals that TOPK and YB1 are essential for the 
growth of EC, and TOPK inhibitors may be applied to retard cell proliferation in 
EC. This study highlights the promising therapeutic potential of TOPK as a 
target for treatment of EC.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41419-023-05883-0

chromosomal aberrations. While most coding mutations are deleterious, almost all 
protein-coding genes lack detectable signals of negative selection. This raises 
the question of how tumors tolerate such large amounts of deleterious mutations. 
Using 8,690 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that copy 
number amplifications frequently cover haploinsufficient genes in mutation-prone 
regions. This could increase tolerance towards the deleterious impact of 
mutations by creating safe copies of wild-type regions and, hence, protecting 
the genes therein. Our findings demonstrate that these potential buffering 
events are highly influenced by gene functions, essentiality, and mutation 
impact and that they occur early during tumor evolution. We show how cancer 
type-specific mutation landscapes drive copy number alteration patterns across 
cancer types. Ultimately, our work paves the way for the detection of novel 
cancer vulnerabilities by revealing genes that fall within amplifications likely

which modulate glucose and lipid homeostasis. However, studies investigating the 
association of meal timing and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence are lacking. The 
objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal associations of meal 
timing, number of eating occasions and night-time fasting duration with 
incidence of T2D.
METHODS: In total, 103 312 adults [79% women, mean age at baseline = 42.7 (SD = 
14.6)] from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-21) were included. Participants' 
meal timings and frequency were assessed using repeated 24-h dietary records and 
averaged from the first 2 years of follow-up (5.7 records/participant). 
Associations of meal timing, number of eating occasions and night-time fasting 
duration with incidence of T2D were assessed by using multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.3 years, 963 new cases of T2D were 
ascertained. Compared with participants habitually having a first meal before 
8AM, those eating after 9AM had a higher incidence of T2D (HR = 1.59, 95% CI 
1.30-1.94). Time of last meal was not associated with T2D incidence. Each 
additional eating episode was associated with a lower incidence of T2D 
(HR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.99). Night-time fasting duration was not associated 
with T2D incidence, except in participants having breakfast before 8AM and 
fasting for >13 h overnight (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, a later first meal was associated 
with a higher incidence of T2D. If confirmed in other large-scale studies, an 
early breakfast should be considered in preventing T2D.","© The Author(s) 2023; all rights reserved. Published by Oxford University Press

cancers. Intrinsic resistance to hypoxia is a major cause for the failure of 
anti-angiogenic therapy, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, it 
is revealed that N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), a newly identified mRNA modification, 
enhances hypoxia tolerance in gastric cancer (GC) cells by promoting glycolysis 
addiction. Specifically, acetyltransferase NAT10 transcription is regulated by 
HIF-1α, a key transcription factor of the cellular response to hypoxia. Further, 
acRIP-sequencing, Ribosome profiling sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and functional 
studies confirm that NAT10 in turn activates the HIF-1 pathway and subsequent 
glucose metabolism reprogramming by mediating SEPT9 mRNA ac4C modification. The 
formation of the NAT10/SEPT9/HIF-1α positive feedback loop leads to excessive 
activation of the HIF-1 pathway and induces glycolysis addiction. Combined 
anti-angiogenesis and ac4C inhibition attenuate hypoxia tolerance and inhibit 
tumor progression in vivo. This study highlights the critical roles of ac4C in 
the regulation of glycolysis addiction and proposes a promising strategy to 
overcome resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy by combining apatinib with ac4C

originates from a small subpopulation of TNBC stem cells (TNBCSCs), and these 
TNBCSCs give rise to chemoresistance, tumor metastasis, and recurrence. 
Unfortunately, traditional chemotherapy eradicates normal TNBC cells but fails 
to kill quiescent TNBCSCs. To explore a new strategy for eradicating TNBCSCs, a 
disulfide-mediated self-assembly nano-prodrug that can achieve the co-delivery 
of ferroptosis drug, differentiation-inducing agent, and chemotherapeutics for 
simultaneous TNBCSCs and TNBC treatment, is reported. In this nano-prodrug, the 
disulfide bond not only induces self-assembly behavior of different small 
molecular drug but also serves as a glutathione (GSH)-responsive trigger in 
controlled drug release. More importantly, the differentiation-inducing agent 
can transform TNBCSCs into normal TNBC cells, and this differentiation with 
chemotherapeutics provides an effective approach to indirectly eradicate 
TNBCSCs. In addition, ferroptosis therapy is essentially different from the 
apoptosis-induced cell death of differentiation or chemotherapeutic, which 
causes cell death to both TNBCSCs and normal TNBC cells. In different TNBC mouse 
models, this nano-prodrug significantly improves anti-tumor efficacy and 
effectively inhibits the tumor metastasis. This all-in-one strategy enables 
controlled drug release and reduces stemness-related drug resistance, enhancing 
the chemotherapeutic sensitivity in TNBC treatment.",© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.,"DOI: 10.1002/smll.202301600

markers (TMs) measurements in determining the indications for conversion surgery 
(CS) in the management of unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
(UR-LAPC).
METHODS: A total of 103 patients with UR-LAPC, treated between 2008 and June 
2021, were enrolled in this study. Three TMs, including carbohydrate antigen 
19-9 (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and Duke pancreatic monoclonal 
antigen type 2 (DUPAN-2), were measured.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (24%) underwent CS. The median preoperative 
treatment period was 9.5 months. The median survival time (MST) from the initial 
treatment for patients with CS was significantly longer than that for patients 
without surgery (34.6 vs. 18.9 months, P < 0.001). The number of elevated TMs 
before CS was one in five patients and two in five patients, while 15 patients 
had normal levels of all three TMs. Notably, the MST from the initial treatment 
for patients with all three preoperative normal TMs levels was favorable for 
70.5 months. In contrast, patients with one or two preoperatively elevated TMs 
levels had a significantly worse prognosis (25.4 and 21.0 months, respectively, 
P < 0.001). Furthermore, the relapse-free survival of patients with three 
preoperative normal TMs levels was significantly longer than those with one or 
two elevated TMs levels (21.9 vs. 11.3 or 3.0 months, respectively, P < 0.001). 
Non-normal values of all TMs before CS were identified as independent poor 
prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous measurement and assessment of the three TMs levels may 
help determine the surgical indications for UR-LAPC after systemic anticancer 
treatment.",Copyright © 2023 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.pan.2023.06.001

hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava remains a surgical challenge. Liver 
resection under total vascular exclusion with or without extracorporeal bypass 
has been described as a therapeutic option for these tumors. Here, we present 
our experience with these complex surgical methods.
METHODS: We searched our database for patients treated with an in-situ or 
ante-situm liver resection (ISR and ASR, respectively) with extracorporeal 
bypass. We collected demographic and perioperative data.
RESULTS: From January 2010 to December 2021, we performed 2122 liver resections. 
Nine patients were treated with ASR and five were treated with ISR. Out of these 
14 patients, six had colorectal liver metastases, six had cholangiocarcinoma, 
and two had non-colorectal liver metastases. The median operative time and 
bypass time in all patients were 536.5 and 150 min, respectively. Compared with 
ISR, ASR required a longer operative time (ASR 586 min and ISR 495 min) and a 
longer bypass time (ASR 155 min and ISR 122 min). Morbidity (Clavien-Dindo grade 
> 3A adverse events) occurred in 78.5% of patients. 90-day postoperative 
mortality was 7%. Median overall survival was 33 months. Seven patients 
experienced recurrence. In these patients, median disease-free survival was 9 
months.
CONCLUSION: Resection of tumors infiltrating the hepatic outflow poses a high 
risk for patients. However, with rigorous selection and an experienced 
perioperative team, these patients can be treated surgically with reasonable 
oncological outcomes.","Copyright © 2023 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.

with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an 
increasing demand for additional analysis regarding the efficacy and safety of 
after the initial series of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in Japanese transplant 
recipients.
METHOD: In this open-label, nonrandomized prospective study carried out at 
Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan, LTx recipients and controls received 
third doses of either the BNT162b2 or the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and the cellular 
and humoral immune responses were analyzed.
RESULTS: A cohort of 39 LTx recipients and 38 controls participated in the 
study. The third dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine promoted much greater humoral 
responses at 53.9 % of LTx recipients than after the initial series at 28.2 % of 
patients without increasing the risk of adverse events. However, still fewer LTx 
recipients responded to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the median IgG titer 
of 129.8 AU/mL and with the median IFN-γ level of 0.01 IU/mL when compared to 
controls with those of 7394 AU/mL and 0.70 IU/mL, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although the third dose of mRNA vaccine in LTx recipients was 
effective and safe, impaired cellular and humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein were noted. Given lower antibody production and establishing vaccine 
safety, repeating the administration of mRNA vaccine will lead to robust 
protection in such a high-risk population (jRCT1021210009).",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2023.06.011

combined with external beam radiotherapy (HDR-B), are both suitable treatments 
for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. However, data directly comparing these 
two approaches for men with unfavorable intermediate-risk (UIR) patients are 
lacking.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with NCCN-defined UIR prostate cancer treated 
from 1997 to 2020 were identified in a prospectively maintained, single 
institution database. HDR-M and HDR-B patients were matched using three factors: 
age ±3 years; Gleason score (major and minor); and clinical T stage. Biochemical 
failure was defined as PSA nadir (nPSA) + 2. Available acute and chronic 
toxicities are additionally reported.
RESULTS: A total of 247 patients were identified (170 receiving HDR-B, 77 
receiving HDR-M), ultimately yielding 70 matched pairs (140 patients) for 
inclusion. The median followup time was 5.2 years for HDR-M compared with 9.3 
years for HDR-B (p < 0.001). The two cohorts had similar calculated prostate 
EQD2 (HDR-B 118 Gy vs. HDR-M 115 Gy, p = 0.977). No significant differences in 
OS, CSS, DM, LRR, or FFBF were identified. HDR-B had an increased rate of any 
acute grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity and worse acute dysuria and diarrhea. 
Chronic gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy is an 
effective treatment option for selected patients with unfavorable 
intermediate-risk prostate cancer and provides a more favorable gastrointestinal 
toxicity profile than HDR-B. Prospective trials should be conducted to refine 
the selection process for this heterogeneous cohort of patients.","Copyright © 2023 American Brachytherapy Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

treatment among breast cancer survivors with neuropathic pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using 
the SEER-Medicare linked database. We included female breast cancer survivors 
diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer (stages 0-III) between 2007 and 2015 
who developed treatment-related neuropathic pain during their survivorship 
period. Guideline-concordant treatment was defined based on NCCN guidelines. 
Factors associated with receiving guideline-concordant treatment were assessed 
using multivariable logistic regression and backward selection was used to 
identify potential associated factors.
RESULTS: Around 16.7% of breast cancer survivors in the study developed a 
neuropathic pain condition. The mean time to develop neuropathic pain was 1.4 
years after beginning adjuvant treatment. On average, patients who developed 
neuropathic pain and received guideline-concordant treatment did so at 2.4 
months after their neuropathic pain diagnosis. We found that survivors that are 
black and of other races were less likely to receive guideline-concordant 
treatment for breast cancer treatment-related neuropathic pain. Whereas 
survivors with diabetes, mental health disorders, hemiplegia, prior continuous 
opioid use, benzodiazepine use, nonbenzodiazepine CNS depressant use, or 
antipsychotic medication use were less likely to receive guideline-concordant 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that minority races, prior medication use, and 
comorbid conditions are associated with guideline-concordant treatment among 
breast cancer survivors with neuropathic pain. These findings warrant attention 
towards minority races to prescribe them guideline-concordant treatment as well 
as caution when prescribing concurrent pain medications to survivors with 
comorbidities and prior medication use.",Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2023.05.002

hyperplasia (ADH), excision is typically recommended. The natural history of ADH 
undergoing active surveillance (AS) is not well described. We investigate the 
rates of upgrade to malignancy of excised ADH and the rates of radiographic 
progression under AS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 220 cases of ADH 
on NCB. Of patients who had surgery within 6 months of NCB, we examined the 
malignancy upgrade rate. In the AS cohort, we examined rates of radiographic 
progression on interval imaging.
RESULTS: The malignancy upgrade rate among patients who underwent immediate 
excision (n = 185) was 15.7%: 14.1% (n = 26) ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 
1.6% (n = 3) invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Upgrade to malignancy was less 
common in lesions <4 mm in size (0%) or with focal ADH (5%), and more common 
among lesions presenting with a radiographic mass (26%). Among the 35 patients 
who underwent AS, median follow-up was 20 months. Two lesions progressed on 
imaging (incidence 3.8% at 2 years). One patient without radiographic 
progression was found to have IDC at delayed surgery. The remaining lesions 
remained stable (46%), decreased in size (11%), or resolved (37%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that AS is a safe approach to managing ADH on 
NCB for most patients. This could spare many patients with ADH from unnecessary 
surgery. Given that AS is being investigated for low-risk DCIS in multiple 
international prospective trials, these results suggest that AS should also be 
investigated for ADH.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2023.05.008

(NEN) in the population makes this a common, prevalent and a clinically relevant 
disease group. Surgical resection represents the only potentially curative 
treatment for digestive NENs. Thus, resection should in principle be considered 
for all patients with NEN, although taking the patients age, relevant 
comorbidity, and performance status into account for operability. Patients with 
insulinomas, NEN of the appendix and rectal NENs are usually cured by surgery 
alone. However, less than a third of patients are amendable to curative surgery 
alone at time of diagnosis. Furthermore, recurrence is common and may occur 
years after primary surgery, hence the long follow-up time recommended in most 
NENs (>10 years). As many patients with NENs present with locoregional or 
metastatic disease, there is considerable debate regarding the role of debulking 
surgery in these settings. However, good long-term survival can be achieved in a 
considerable proportion of patients, with 50-70% alive up to 10 years after 
surgery. Location and grade are the main determinants of long-term survival.

traditionally excluded from clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICI) due to concerns for toxicity. As indications for ICI expand, more data are 
needed on the safety and efficacy of ICI treatment in cancer patients with AID.
METHODS: We systematically searched for studies consisting of NSCLC, AID, ICI, 
treatment response, and adverse events. Outcomes of interest include incidence 
of autoimmune flare, irAE, response rate, and ICI discontinuation. Study data 
were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from 24 cohort studies, consisting of 11,567 cancer 
patients (3774 NSCLC patients and 1157 with AID). Pooled analysis revealed an 
AID flare incidence of 36% (95% CI, 27%-46%) in all cancers and 23% (95% CI, 
9%-40%) in NSCLC. Preexisting AID was associated with an increased risk of de 
novo irAE in all cancer patients (RR 1.38, 95% CI, 1.16-1.65) and NSCLC patients 
(RR 1.51, 95% CI, 1.12-2.03). There was no difference in de novo grade 3 to 4 
irAE and tumor response between cancer patients with and without AID. However, 
in NSCLC patients, preexisting AID was associated with a 2-fold increased risk 
of de novo grade 3 to 4 irAE (RR 1.95, 95% CI, 1.01-3.75) but also better tumor 
response in achieving a complete or partial response (RR 1.56, 95% CI, 
1.19-2.04).
CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC patients with AID are at a higher risk of grade 3 to 4 irAE 
but are more likely to achieve treatment response. Prospective studies focused 
on optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes for 
NSCLC patients with AID.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.cllc.2023.05.006

(IBC) after surviving for several years was unclear. We aimed to estimate 
survival over time in IBC using conditional survival (CS) and annual hazard 
functions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study recruited 679 patients diagnosed with IBC 
between 2010 and 2019 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER) database. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival 
(OS). CS was the probability of surviving for another y years after surviving 
for x years after the diagnosis, and the annual hazard rate was the cumulative 
mortality rate of follow-up patients. Cox regression analyses were used to 
identify prognostic factors, and changes in real-time survival and immediate 
mortality in surviving patients were assessed within these prognostic factors.
RESULTS: CS analysis showed real-time improvement in survival, with 5-year OS 
updated annually from the initial 43.5% to 52.2%, 65.3%, 78.5%, and 89.0% 
(surviving 1-4 years, respectively). However, this improvement was relatively 
small in the first two years after diagnosis, and the smoothed annual hazard 
rate curve showed increasing mortality during this period. Cox regression 
identified seven unfavorable factors at diagnosis, but only distant metastases 
remained after five years of survival. Analysis of the annual hazard rate curves 
showed that mortality continued to decrease for most survivors, except for 
metastatic IBC.
CONCLUSION: Real-time survival of IBC improved dynamically over time, and the 
magnitude of this improvement was non-linear, depending on survival time and 
clinicopathological characteristics.","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and

in Endometrial Cancer (EC) patients, many efforts have been made to maximize the 
SLN bilateral detection rate. However, at present, no previous research assessed 
the potential correlation between primary EC location in the uterine cavity and 
SLN mapping. In this context, this study aims to investigate the possible role 
of intrauterine EC hysteroscopic localization in predicting SLN nodal placement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: EC patients surgically treated from January 2017 to 
December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and SLN mapping. During 
hysteroscopy, the location of the neoplastic lesion was described as follows: 
uterine fundus (comprising the most cranial portion of the uterine cavity up to 
the tubal ostium including the cornual areas), corpus uteri (from the tubal 
ostium to the inner uterine orifice), and diffuse (when the tumor invades more 
than 50% of the uterine cavity).
RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients met the inclusion criteria. The tumor 
pattern diffused to the whole uterine cavity was statistically associated with 
SLN uptake on common iliac lymph nodes (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1-5.8, p = 0.05). 
Patients'age is an independent factor associated with SLN failure (OR: 0.95, 
95%CI 0.93-0.98, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a statistically significant association between EC 
hysteroscopically spread throughout the whole uterine cavity and SLN uptake at 
the common iliac lymph nodes. Furthermore, patient age negatively affected the 
SLN detection rate.","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and

heat strain experienced by chronically ill and elderly patients via different 
mechanistic pathways. Human thermoregulation is a crucial homeostatic process 
that maintains body temperature within a narrow range during heat stress through 
dry (i.e., increasing skin blood flow) and evaporative (i.e., sweating) heat 
loss, as well as active inhibition of thermogenesis, which is crucial to avoid 
overheating. Medications can independently and synergistically interact with 
ageing and chronic disease to alter homeostatic responses to rising body 
temperature during heat stress. This review focuses on the physiological 
changes, with specific emphasis on thermolytic processes, associated with 
medication use during heat stress. The review begins by providing readers with a 
background of the global chronic disease burden. Human thermoregulation and 
ageing effects are then summarised to give an understanding of the unique 
physiological changes faced by older adults. The effects of common chronic 
diseases on temperature regulation are outlined in the main sections. 
Physiological impacts of common medications used to treat these diseases are 
reviewed in detail, with emphasis on the mechanisms by which these medications 
alter thermolysis during heat stress. The review concludes by providing 
perspectives on the need to understand the effects of medication use in hot 
environments, as well as a summary table of all clinical considerations and 
research needs of the medications included in this review. Significance 
Statement Long-term medications modulate thermoregulatory function, resulting in 
excess physiological strain and predisposing patients to adverse health outcomes 
during prolonged exposures to extreme heat during rest and physical work (e.g., 
exercise). Understanding the medication-specific mechanisms of altered 
thermoregulation has importance to both clinical and research fraternities, 
paving the way for work towards refining current medication prescription 
recommendations and formulating mitigation strategies for adverse drug effects 
in the heat in chronically ill patients.","DOI: 10.1124/pharmrev.122.000782

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is important as 
they cause treatment interruption or discontinuation, more often seen with 
combination immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Here, we retrospectively 
evaluated the safety and effectiveness of anti-interleukin-6 receptor 
(anti-IL-6R) as therapy for irAEs.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter study evaluating patients 
diagnosed with de novo irAEs or flare of pre-existing autoimmune disease 
following ICI and were treated with anti-IL-6R. Our objectives were to assess 
the improvement of irAEs as well as the overall tumor response rate (ORR) before 
and after anti-IL-6R treatment.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 92 patients who received therapeutic 
anti-IL-6R antibodies (tocilizumab or sarilumab). Median age was 61 years, 63% 
were men, 69% received anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies 
alone, and 26% patients were treated with the combination of anti-cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte antigen-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Cancer types were primarily 
melanoma (46%), genitourinary cancer (35%), and lung cancer (8%). Indications 
for using anti-IL-6R antibodies included inflammatory arthritis (73%), 
hepatitis/cholangitis (7%), myositis/myocarditis/myasthenia gravis (5%), 
polymyalgia rheumatica (4%), and one patient each with autoimmune scleroderma, 
nephritis, colitis, pneumonitis and central nervous system vasculitis. Notably, 
88% of patients had received corticosteroids, and 36% received other 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as first-line therapies, but 
without adequate improvement. After initiation of anti-IL-6R (as first-line or 
post-corticosteroids and DMARDs), 73% of patients showed resolution or change to 
≤grade 1 of irAEs after a median of 2.0 months from initiation of anti-IL-6R 
therapy. Six patients (7%) stopped anti-IL-6R due to adverse events. Of 70 
evaluable patients by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 
V.1.1 criteria; the ORR was 66% prior versus 66% after anti-IL-6R (95% CI, 54% 
to 77%), with 8% higher complete response rate. Of 34 evaluable patients with 
melanoma, the ORR was 56% prior and increased to 68% after anti-IL-6R (p=0.04).
CONCLUSION: Targeting IL-6R could be an effective approach to treat several irAE 
types without hindering antitumor immunity. This study supports ongoing clinical 
trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R antibody) 
in combination with ICIs (NCT04940299, NCT03999749).","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

cells into the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a key mechanism underlying 
immunotherapy resistance. We recently reported a novel role of discoidin 
domain-containing receptor 1 (DDR1) in promoting IE in breast cancer and 
validated its critical role in IE using neutralizing rabbit monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) in multiple mouse tumor models.
METHODS: To develop a DDR1-targeting mAb as a potential cancer therapeutic, we 
humanized mAb9 with a complementarity-determining region grafting strategy. The 
humanized antibody named PRTH-101 is currently being tested in a Phase 1 
clinical trial. We determined the binding epitope of PRTH-101 from the crystal 
structure of the complex between DDR1 extracellular domain (ECD) and the 
PRTH-101 Fab fragment with 3.15 Å resolution. We revealed the underlying 
mechanisms of action of PRTH-101 using both cell culture assays and in vivo 
study in a mouse tumor model.
RESULTS: PRTH-101 has subnanomolar affinity to DDR1 and potent antitumor 
efficacy similar to the parental rabbit mAb after humanization. Structural 
information illustrated that PRTH-101 interacts with the discoidin (DS)-like 
domain, but not the collagen-binding DS domain of DDR1. Mechanistically, we 
showed that PRTH-101 inhibited DDR1 phosphorylation, decreased collagen-mediated 
cell attachment, and significantly blocked DDR1 shedding from the cell surface. 
Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with PRTH-101 in vivo disrupted collagen fiber 
alignment (a physical barrier) in the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) and 
enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study not only paves a pathway for the development of PRTH-101 
as a cancer therapeutic, but also sheds light on a new therapeutic strategy to 
modulate collagen alignment in the tumor ECM for enhancing antitumor immunity.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The addition of nivolumab to trastuzumab and chemotherapy in 
first-line unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive esophagogastric 
adenocarcinoma (HER2+ EGA) results in long progression-free and overall survival 
as shown by the INTEGA (ipilimumab or FOLFOX in combination with nivolumab and 
trastuzumab in HER2 positive esophagogastric adenocarcinoma) trial. This trial 
suggested that the chemotherapy backbone is needed in an unselected HER2+ 
patient population. Yet, it remains an open question if there are specific 
patient subsets that may benefit from an enhanced immunotherapeutic but 
chemotherapy-free approach.
METHODS: We analyzed blood T cell repertoire metrics determined by 
next-generation sequencing, circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts detected by 
CellSearch and their expression of HER2 and PD-L1 as potential liquid biomarkers 
predicting outcomes on ipilimumab versus FOLFOX (folinic acid, FOL, 
fluorouracil, F, oxaliplatin, OX) chemotherapy added to a backbone of 
trastuzumab and nivolumab in patients with HER2+ EGA in the INTEGA trial 
population.
RESULTS: Patients with two out of three baseline-determined liquid 
biomarkers-high T cell repertoire richness, absence of CTCs or HER2-expression 
on CTCs-made up approximately 44% of HER2+ EGA cases and did not show compromise 
in efficacy if treated with a chemotherapy-free regimen. Long-term responders 
showing a progression-free survival of >12 months were enriched in this 
biomarker triad, especially if treated on the chemotherapy-free arm.
CONCLUSION: Prospective validation of this liquid biomarker triad is needed to 
molecularly define HER2+ EGA patient subsets with different needs in the 
first-line systemic treatment setting.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

acid-reducing agent (rabeprazole) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of 
capivasertib, a potent AKT inhibitor, in clinical development for cancer 
treatment.
METHODS: In Part 1, healthy participants (n=24) were randomised to receive 
single-dose capivasertib after overnight fasting, a high-fat, high-calorie meal 
and with rabeprazole post-overnight fasting in one of six treatment sequences. 
Based on Part 1 results, a new group of participants (n=24) were randomised 
(Part 2) to receive capivasertib after overnight fasting, a low-fat, low-calorie 
meal and modified fasting (food restricted from 2 hours before dosing to 1 hour 
post-dose) in one of six treatment sequences. Blood samples were collected for 
PK analyses.
RESULTS: Following a high-fat, high-calorie meal, capivasertib exposure 
increased versus overnight fasting (geometric mean ratio [GMR 90% CI]: area 
under the concentration-time curve [AUCinf ] 1.32 [1.22, 1.43]; maximum 
concentration [Cmax ] 1.23 [1.08, 1.41]), but was comparable to that 
post-modified fasting (GMR: AUCinf 1.13 [0.99, 1.29]; Cmax 0.85 [0.70, 1.04]). 
AUCinf was similar and Cmax was lower with/without rabeprazole (GMR: AUCinf 0.94 
[0.87, 1.02]); Cmax 0.73 [0.64, 0.84]). Capivasertib exposure was similar after 
a low-fat, low-calorie meal versus overnight fasting (GMR: AUCinf 1.14 [1.05, 
1.25]; Cmax 1.21 [0.99, 1.48]) or modified fasting (GMR: AUCinf 0.96 [0.88, 
1.05]; Cmax 0.86 [0.70, 1.06]). Safety was consistent with that in larger 
trials.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that administering capivasertib with food or 
acid-reducing agents does not lead to clinically relevant PK or safety profile

aldehydes (hexanal and heptanal) as lung cancer biomarkers in saliva samples is 
presented for the first time. The method is based on a modification of magnetic 
headspace adsorptive microextraction (M-HS-AME) followed by gas chromatography 
coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For this purpose, an external magnetic 
field generated by a neodymium magnet is used to hold the magnetic sorbent 
(i.e., CoFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles embedded into a reversed-phase polymer) in 
the headspace of a microtube to extract the volatilized aldehydes. Subsequently, 
the analytes are desorbed in the appropriate solvent and the extract is injected 
into the GC-MS system for separation and determination. Under the optimized 
conditions, the method was validated and showed good analytical features in 
terms of linearity (at least up to 50 ng mL-1), limits of detection (0.22 and 
0.26 ng mL-1 for hexanal and heptanal, respectively), and repeatability (RSD 
≤12%). This new approach was successfully applied to saliva samples from healthy 
volunteers and those with lung cancer, obtaining notably differences between 
both groups. These results reveal the prospect of the method as potential 
diagnostic tool for lung cancer by saliva analysis. This work contributes to the 
Analytical Chemistry field presenting a double novelty: on the one hand, the use 
of M-HS-AME in bioanalysis is unprecedentedly proposed, thus expanding the 
analytical potential of this technique, and, on the other hand, the 
determination of hexanal and heptanal is carried out in saliva samples for the

replaces 1% of thymine in kinetoplastid flagellates. The biosynthesis and 
maintenance of base-J depends on the base-J-binding protein 1 (JBP1) that has a 
thymidine hydroxylase domain and a J-DNA-binding domain (JDBD). How the 
thymidine hydroxylase domain synergizes with the JDBD to hydroxylate thymine in 
specific genomic sites, maintaining base-J during semi-conservative DNA 
replication, remains unclear. Here, we present a crystal structure of the JDBD

point for molecular dynamics simulations and computational docking studies to 
propose recognition models for JDBD binding to J-DNA. These models guided 
mutagenesis experiments, providing additional data for docking, which reveals a 
binding mode for JDBD onto J-DNA. This model, together with the crystallographic 
structure of the TET2 JBP1-homologue in complex with DNA and the AlphaFold model 
of full-length JBP1, allowed us to hypothesize that the flexible JBP1 N-terminus 
contributes to DNA-binding, which we confirmed experimentally. Α high-resolution

psychosocial benefits for breast cancer survivors. While evidence exists 
regarding recommendations for the frequency, duration and intensity of exercise 
that optimise PA benefits for cancer survivors, the role of the environment in 
achieving optimal outcomes has yet to be determined. This paper presents a 
protocol for a clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of a 3-month 
nature-based walking programme for breast cancer survivors. Secondary outcomes 
assessed include the impact of the intervention on fitness, quality of life 
outcomes, and biomarkers of ageing and inflammation.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The trial is a 12-week single-arm pilot study. Twenty 
female breast cancer survivors will engage in a supervised moderate intensity 
walking intervention in small groups in a nature reserve for 50 minutes three 
times per week. Data will be collected at baseline and end of study, and include 
assessment of inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory myokines (TNF-α, 
IL-1ß, IL-6, CRP, TGF-ß, IL-10, IL-13), as well as ageing (DNA methylation, 
ageing genes) biomarkers; surveys (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System-29, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, 
Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory); and fitness assessments (6 min Walk Test, 
Grip-Strength, One Repetition-Maximum Leg Press). Participants will also 
complete weekly surveys assessing social support and participate in an exit 
interview. This is an important first step for future research on the influence 
of exercise environment on cancer survivor PA outcomes.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Cedars Sinai Medical 
Center Institutional Review Board (IIT2020-20). Findings will be disseminated 
through academic manuscripts, conferences, and community presentations.

multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
specifically in relation to the magnitude of information technology (IT) issues 
and distractions and MDT members'/managers' perceptions and experiences of this 
shift.
DESIGN: A mixed methods study comprising real-time observations of IT 
issues/distractions within virtual MDTM case discussions held between April and 
July 2021 and qualitative data from interviews/surveys.
SETTING: Eight hospital organisations in Southern England.
PARTICIPANTS: Team members (respiratory physicians, surgeons, oncologists, 
radiologists, pathologists, palliative care professionals, nurses and MDT 
coordinators) and managers (n=190) across 8 local MDTs.
RESULTS: MDTM observations (n=1664) highlighted significant variation between 
teams regarding IT functionality. IT issues and other distractions relating to 
the virtual MDTM format were observed 465 times affecting 20.6% of case 
discussions, most of which were audio issues (18.1%). Case discussions that had 
audio issues were, on average, 26 s longer (t(1652)=-2.77, p<0.01). A total of 
73 MDT members and managers participated in the survey and 41 participated in 
interviews, with all 8 teams being represented. Increased flexibility, reduced 
travel time and easier real-time access to patient information were seen as the 
main advantages of virtual MDTMs. Views regarding the impact on relational 
aspects and communication differed. In line with observational findings, 
concerns were raised in relation to IT, including having inappropriate 
equipment, insufficient bandwidth (impairing image sharing and video 
communication) and an overarching theme that virtual meeting platforms provided 
were not fit for purpose.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential benefits of virtual MDTMs, IT issues can 
waste valuable MDTM time. If hospital organisations plan to continue virtual 
MDTMs, a functioning infrastructure is required, necessitating appropriate 
resource and investment.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

relatively frequent develop second primary tumors (SPTs) in the esophagus. 
Endoscopic screening could lead to timely detection of SPTs in early stages and 
therefore improves the survival.
METHODS: We performed a prospective endoscopic screening study in patients with 
HNSCC in a Western country. Patients with curably treated HNSCC diagnosed 
January 2017 to July 2021 were included. Routine imaging for HNSCC consisted of 
flexible transnasal endoscopy with PET/CT or MRI-scan, depending on primary 
HNSCC location. Screening was performed synchronously(<6 months) or 
metachronously (≥6 months) after HNSCC diagnosis. The primary outcome was 
prevalence of SPTs, defined as presence of esophageal high-grade dysplasia or 
squamous cell carcinoma.
RESULTS: We included 202 patients (81% male, mean age 65 years) and performed 
250 screening endoscopies. HNSCC was located in the oropharynx(32%), 
hypopharynx(26%), larynx(22%), and oral cavity(19%). Endoscopic screening was 
performed within 6 months(34%), 6 months to 1 year(8%), 1 to 2 years(34%), and 2 
to 5 years(24%) after HNSCC diagnosis. We detected 11 SPTs in 10 patients(5.0%, 
95%CI: 2.4-8.9%) during synchronous(6/85) and metachronous screening(5/165). 
Most SPTs were detected in early stages(91%) and treated with curative intent 
with endoscopic resection(80%). No SPTs in screened patients were detected with 
routine imaging for HNSCC before endoscopic screening.
CONCLUSION: In 5% of patients with HNSCC, an SPT was detected with endoscopic 
screening. Endoscopic screening should be considered in a selection of HNSCC 
patients to detect early-stage SPTs, based on highest SPT-risk and life 
expectancy depending on HNSCC and comorbidities.","The Author(s). This is an open access article published by Thieme under the

is one of the top selling herbicides on the global market. Due to rain events 
and run-off, the potential for acetochlor-induced toxicity is a concern for 
aquatic species. Here we review the current state of knowledge regarding the 
concentrations of acetochlor in aquatic ecosystems globally and synthesize the 
biological impacts of acetochlor exposure to fish. We compile toxicity effects 
of acetochlor, outlining evidence for morphological defects, developmental 
toxicity, endocrine and immune system disruption, cardiotoxicity, oxidative 
stress, and altered behavior. To identify mechanisms of toxicity, we utilized 
computational toxicology and molecular docking approaches to uncover putative 
toxicity pathways. Using the comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD), 
transcripts responsive to acetochlor were captured and graphically depicted 
using String-DB. Gene-ontology analysis revealed that acetochlor may disrupt 
protein synthesis, blood coagulation, signaling pathways, and receptor activity 
in zebrafish. Further pathway analysis revealed potential novel targets for 
acetochlor disruption at the molecular level (e.g., TNF alpha, heat shock 
proteins), highlighting cancer, reproduction, and the immune system as 
biological processes associated with exposure. Highly interacting proteins in 
these gene networks (e.g., nuclear receptors) were selected to model binding 
potential of acetochlor using SWISS-MODEL. The models were used in molecular 
docking to strengthen evidence for the hypothesis that acetochlor acts as an 
endocrine disruptor, and results suggest estrogen receptor alpha and thyroid 
hormone receptor beta may be preferential targets for disruption. Lastly, this 
comprehensive review reveals that, unlike other herbicides, immunotoxicity nor 
behavioral toxicity have been fully investigated as sub-lethal endpoints for 
acetochlor, and such mechanisms of toxicity should be emphasized in future 
research investigating biological responses of fish to the herbicide.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.cbpc.2023.109685

by wearers and cause adverse health effects. Here, we first used headspace 
solid-phase microextraction coupled with GC-MS to comprehensively analyze the 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from 26 types of face masks. The 
results showed that total concentrations and peak numbers ranged from 3.28 to 
197 μg/mask and 81 to 162, respectively, for different types of mask. Also, 
light exposure could affect the chemical composition of VOCs, particularly 
increasing the concentrations of aldehydes, ketones, organic acids and esters. 
Of these detected VOCs, 142 substances were matched to a reported database of 
chemicals associated with plastic packaging; 30 substances were identified by 
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as potential carcinogenic 
to humans; 6 substances were classified in the European Union as persistent, 
bioaccumulative, and toxic, or very persistent, very bioaccumulative substance. 
Reactive carbonyls were ubiquitous in masks, especially after exposure to light. 
The potential risk of VOCs released from the face masks were then accessed by 
assuming the extreme scenario that all the VOC residues were released into the 
breathing air within 3 h. The result showed that the average total concentration 
of VOCs (17 μg/m3) was below the criterion for hygienic air, but seven 
substances, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol, benzene, isophorone, heptanal, naphthalene, 
benzyl chloride, and 1,2-dichloropropane exceeded the non-cancer health 
guidelines for lifetime exposure. This finding suggested that specific 
regulations should be adopted to improve the chemical safety of face masks.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122042

adaptability in such an aggravating environment is limited. Thus, the present 
investigation based on an iono-metabolomic approach is aimed to decipher the 
response of wheat genotypes towards As toxicity. Wheat genotypes procured from 
natural conditions were characterized as high As-contaminated (Shri ram-303 and 
HD-2967) and low As-contaminated (Malviya-234 and DBW-17) based on ICP-MS As 
accumulation analysis. Reduced chlorophyll fluorescence attributes, grain yield 
and quality traits, and low grain nutrient status were accompanied by remarkable 
grain As accumulation in high As-contaminated genotypes, thus imposing a higher 
potential cancer risk and hazard quotient. Contrarily, in low As-contaminated 
genotypes, the richness of Zn, N, Fe, Mn, Na, K, Mg, and Ca could probably have 
supported less grain As accumulation, imparting better agronomic and grain 
quality traits. Additionally, from metabolomic analysis (LC-MS/MS and UHPLC), 
abundances of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, 
trans-ferrulic, cinnamic, caffeic, and syringic bestow Malviya-234 as the best 
edible wheat genotype. Further, the multivariate statistical analysis (HCA, PCA, 
and PLS-DA) revealed certain other key metabolites (rutin, nobletin, myricetin, 
catechin, and naringenin) based genotypic discrimination that imparts strength 
to genotypes for better adaptation in harsh conditions. Out of the 5 metabolic 
pathways ascertained through topological analysis, the two main pathways vital 
for plant's metabolic adjustments in an As-induced environment were: 1. The 
alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway, and 2. The flavonoid 
biosynthesis pathway. This is also evident from network analysis, which 
stipulates amino acid metabolism as a prominent As regulatory factor closely 
associated with flavonoids and phenolics. Therefore, the present findings are 
useful for wheat breeding programs to develop As adaptive genotypes that are 
beneficial for crop improvement and human health.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122040

to inhibit the growth and metastasis of lung cancer. We have reported that 
chitosan could re-educate the TAMs and then inhibit cancer metastasis; however, 
the re-exposure of chitosan from the chemical corona on their surface is 
critical for this effect. In this study, a strategy was proposed to re-expose 
the chitosan from chemical corona, and a sustained H2S generation was applied to 
enhance the immunotherapy of chitosan. To achieve this objective, an inhalable 
microsphere (namely F/Fm) was designed, which could be degraded by the matrix 
metalloproteinase in lung cancer, releasing two kinds of nanoparticles; in an 
external magnetic field, these nanoparticles can aggregate with each other, and 
β-cyclodextrin on the surface of one nanoparticle can be hydrolyzed by amylase 
on the surface of another nanoparticle, leading to the re-exposure of chitosan 
in the inner layer of β-cyclodextrin and the release of diallyl trisulfide for 
H2S generation. In vitro, the expression of CD86 and secretion of TNF-α by TAMs 
was increased by F/Fm, proving the re-education of TAMs, and the apoptosis of 
A549 cells was promoted with the migration and invasion being inhibited. In the 
Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mouse, the F/Fm re-educated the TAMs and provided a 
sustained generation of H2S in the region of lung cancer, effectively inhibiting

its clinical application is limited owing to its adverse effects, especially 
acute kidney injury (AKI). Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a flavonoid derived from 
Ampelopsis grossedentata, has varied pharmacological activities. This research 
aimed to determine the molecular mechanism for cisplatin-induced AKI.
METHODS: A murine model of cisplatin-induced AKI (22 mg/kg, I.P.) and a HK-2 
cell model of cisplatin-induced damage (30 μM) were established to evaluate the 
protective function of DHM. Renal dysfunction markers, renal morphology and 
potential signaling pathways were investigated.
RESULTS: DHM decreased the levels of renal function biomarkers (blood urea 
nitrogen and serum creatinine), mitigated renal morphological damage, and 
downregulated the protein levels of kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin. It upregulated the expression levels of 
antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase expression), nuclear 
factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream proteins, 
including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) 
and modulatory (GCLM) subunits, thus eventually reducing cisplatin-induced 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, DHM partially inhibited the 
phosphorylation of the active fragments of caspase-8 and -3 and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase and restored glutathione peroxidase 4 
expression, which attenuated renal apoptosis and ferroptosis in 
cisplatin-treated animals. DHM also mitigated the activation of NLRP3 
inflammasome and nuclear factor (NF)-κB, attenuating the inflammatory response. 
In addition, it reduced cisplatin-induced HK-2 cell apoptosis and ROS 
production, both of which were blocked by the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385.
CONCLUSIONS: DHM suppressed cisplatin-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and 
ferroptosis probably through regulating of Nrf2/HO-1, MAPK and NF-κB signaling

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine associations of the Healthy Eating Index 
(HEI)-2015, Alternate HEI-2010 (AHEI-2010), and alternate Mediterranean Diet 
Index (aMED) diet quality indices with serum lipidomic profiles.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of HEI-2015, AHEI-2010 and aMED 
with lipidomic profiles from two nested case-control studies within the 
Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO, n=627) and 
the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC, n=711). We 
used multivariable linear regression to determine associations of the indices, 
derived from baseline food frequency questionnaires (PLCO:1993-2001, 
ATBC:1985-1988) with serum concentrations of 904 lipid species and 252 fatty 
acids (FA) across 15 lipid classes and 28 total FAs, within each cohort and 
meta-analyzed results using fixed-effect models for lipids significant at 
Bonferroni-corrected threshold in common in both cohorts.
RESULTS: Adherence to HEI-2015, AHEI-2010 or aMED was associated positively with 
31, 41, and 54 lipid species and 8, 6 and 10 class-specific FAs and inversely 
with 2, 8 and 34 lipid species and 1, 3 and 5 class-specific FAs, respectively. 
Twenty-five lipid species and 5 class-specific FAs were common to all indices, 
predominantly triacylglycerols, FA22:6 (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA])-containing 
species, and DHA. All indices were positively associated with total FA22:6. 
AHEI-2010 and aMED were inversely associated with total FA18:1 (oleic acid) and 
total FA17:0 (margaric acid), respectively. The identified lipids were most 
associated with components of seafood and plant proteins and 
unsaturated:saturated fat ratio in HEI-2015; eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus 
DHA in AHEI-2010; and fish and monounsaturated:saturated fat ratio in aMED.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to HEI-2015, AHEI-2010 and aMED are associated with serum 
lipidomic profiles, mostly triacylglycerols or FA22:6-containing species, which 
are related to seafood and plant proteins, EPA-DHA, fish, or fat ratio index 
components.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.tjnut.2023.06.010

current evidence from prospective studies on the diverse health effects of 
cheese consumption. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to identify 
meta-analyses/pooled analyses of prospective studies examining the associations 
between cheese consumption and major health outcomes from inception to August 
31, 2022. We reanalyzed and updated previous meta-analyses and performed de novo 
meta-analyses with recently published prospective studies, where appropriate. We 
calculated the summary effect size, 95% prediction confidence intervals, 
between-study heterogeneity, small-study effects, and excess significance bias 
for each health outcome. We identified 54 eligible articles of 
meta-analyses/pooled analyses. After adding newly published original articles, 
we performed 35 updated meta-analyses and 4 de novo meta-analyses. Together with 
eight previous meta-analyses, we finally included 47 unique health outcomes. 
Cheese consumption was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (highest 
vs. lowest category: RR=0.95, 95%CI: 0.92, 0.99), cardiovascular mortality 
(RR=0.93, 95%CI: 0.88, 0.99), incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR=0.92, 
95%CI: 0.89, 0.96), coronary heart disease (CHD) (RR=0.92, 95%CI: 0.86, 0.98),

to the NutriGrade scoring system, moderate quality of evidence was observed for 
inverse associations of cheese consumption with all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality, incident CVD, CHD, and stroke, and for null associations with cancer 
mortality, incident hypertension, and prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that

expressed in the adrenal glands, gonads, and hypothalamus which controls 
steroidogenesis and metabolism. There is significant therapeutic interest in 
SF-1 because of its oncogenic properties in adrenocortical cancer. Synthetic 
modulators are attractive for targeting SF-1 for clinical and laboratory 
purposes due to the poor pharmaceutical properties of its native phospholipid 
ligands. While small molecule agonists targeting SF-1 have been synthesized, no 
crystal structures have been reported of SF-1 in complex with synthetic 
compounds. This has prevented the establishment of structure-activity 
relationships that would enable better characterization of ligand-mediated 
activation and improvement of current chemical scaffolds. Here, we compare the 
effects of small molecules in SF-1 and its close homolog, liver receptor 
homolog-1 (LRH-1) and identify several molecules that specifically activate 
LRH-1. We also report the first crystal structure of SF-1 in complex with a 
synthetic agonist that displays low nanomolar affinity and potency for SF-1. We 
use this structure to explore the mechanistic basis for small molecule agonism 
of SF-1, especially compared to LRH-1, and uncover unique signaling pathways 
that drive LRH-1 specificity. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal differences 
in protein dynamics at the pocket mouth, as well as ligand-mediated allosteric 
communication from this region to the coactivator binding interface. Our studies 
therefore shed important insight into the allostery driving SF-1 activity and 
show potential for modulation of LRH-1 over SF-1.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104921

untreatable Schwann cell-derived neoplasms with hyperactive MAPK and mTOR 
signaling pathways. To identify potential therapeutic targets, we previously 
performed genome-scale shRNA screens that implicated the neuregulin-1 (NRG1) 
receptor erbB3 in MPNST proliferation and/or survival. Here, we show that erbB3 
is commonly expressed in MPNSTs and MPNST cell lines and that erbB3 knockdown 
inhibits MPNST proliferation and survival. Kinomic and microarray analyses of 
Schwann and MPNST cells implicate Src and erbB3 mediated calmodulin-regulated 
signaling as key pathways. Consistent with this, inhibition of upstream 
(canertinib, sapitinib, saracatinib, calmodulin) and parallel (AZD1208) 
signaling pathways involving MAPK and mTOR reduced MPNST proliferation and 
survival. ErbB inhibitors (canertinib, sapitinib) or erbB3 knockdown in 
combination with Src (saracatinib), calmodulin (trifluoperazine) or PIM kinase 
(AZD1208) inhibition even more effectively reduces proliferation and survival. 
Drug inhibition enhances an unstudied CaMKII phosphorylation site in a 
Src-dependent manner. The Src family kinase inhibitor saracatinib reduces both 
basal and trifluoperazine-induced erbB3 and CaMKII phosphorylation. Src 
inhibition (saracatinib), like erbB3 knockdown, prevents these phosphorylation 
events and when combined with trifluoperazine even more effectively reduces 
proliferation and survival compared to monotherapy. Our findings implicate

targets in MPNSTs and demonstrate that combinatorial therapies targeting

Injection (CKI) is a Chinese herbal injection made from extracts of Kushen and 
Baituling (Heterosmilax japonica Kunth), containing matrine (MAT), oxymatrine 
(OMT) and other alkaloids with significant anti-tumor activity, and is widely 
used as an adjuvant treatment for cancer in China.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The existing systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) were 
re-evaluated to provide a reference for the clinical application of CKI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SRs/MAs of CKI adjuvant therapy for cancer-related 
diseases were searched in four English language databases: PubMed, Embase, Web 
of Science, and Cochrane Library, all from the time of database construction to 
October 2022. 5 researchers independently conducted literature search and 
identification according to the inclusion criteria, and the data of the final 
literature were independently extracted, and finally the AMSTAR 2 tool, PRISMA 
statement and GRADE classification were used to evaluate the methodological 
quality of the included SRs/MAs, the degree of completeness of reporting and the 
quality of evidence for outcome indicators. Database registration: PROSPERO 
ID：CRD42022361349.
RESULTS: Eighteen SRs/MAs were finally included, with studies covering non-small 
cell lung cancer, primary liver cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, 
breast cancer, head and neck tumors, and cancer-related bone pain. The 
evaluation showed that the methodological quality of the included literature was 
extremely low, but most of the literature reported relatively complete entries; 
nine clinical effectiveness indicators for non-small cell lung cancer and 
digestive system tumors were rated as moderate in the GRADE quality of evidence, 
and the quality of other outcomes was low to very low.
CONCLUSION: CKI is a potentially effective drug for the adjuvant treatment of 
neoplastic diseases and may be more convincing for the adjuvant treatment of 
non-small cell lung cancer and digestive system tumors; however, due to the low 
methodological and evidentiary quality of the current SRs, their effectiveness 
needs to be confirmed by more high-quality evidence-based medical evidence.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2023.116778

currently lacks effective treatments. Clinical studies have shown that epimedium 
(YYH) has therapeutic effects on liver cancer, and some of its prenylflavonoids 
have demonstrated anti-liver cancer activity through multiple mechanisms. 
However, there is still a need for systematic research to uncover the key 
pharmacodynamic material basis and mechanism of YYH.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to screen the anti-cancer material basis of 
YYH via integrating spectrum-effect analysis with serum pharmacochemistry, and 
explore the multi-target mechanisms of YYH against liver cancer by combining 
network pharmacology with metabolomics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-cancer effect of the extract of YYH (E-YYH) was 
first evaluated in mice with xenotransplantation H22 tumor cells burden and 
cultured hepatic cells. Then, the interaction between E-YYH compounds and the 
cytotoxic effects was revealed through spectrum-effect relationship analysis. 
And the cytotoxic effects of screened compounds were verified in hepatic cells. 
Next, UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was employed to identify the absorbed components of 
E-YYH in rat plasma to distinguish anti-cancer components. Subsequently, network 
pharmacology based on anti-cancer materials and metabolomics were used to 
discover the potential anti-tumor mechanisms of YYH. Key targets and biomarkers 
were identified and pathway enrichment analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The anti-cancer effect of E-YYH was verified through in vitro and in 
vivo experiments. Six anti-cancer compounds in plasma (icariin, baohuoside Ⅰ, 
epimedin C, 2″-O-rhamnosyl icariside Ⅱ, epimedin B and sagittatoside B) were 
screened out by spectrum-effect analysis. Forty-five liver-cancer-related 
targets were connected with these compounds. Among these targets, PTGS2, TNF, 
NOS3 and PPARG were considered to be the potential key targets preliminarily 
verified by molecular docking. Meanwhile, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and 
arachidonic acid metabolism were found to be associated with E-YYH's efficacy in 
network pharmacology and metabolomics analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed the characteristics of multi-component, 
multi-target and multi-pathway mechanism of E-YYH. This study also provided an 
experimental basis and scientific evidence for the clinical application and 
rational development of YYH.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2023.116765

pathogens, such as ESKAPE, pose a serious threat to global health. However, the 
development of novel antibiotics is hindered by difficulties in identifying new 
antibiotic targets and the rapid development of drug resistance. Drug 
repurposing is an effective alternative strategy for combating antibiotic 
resistance that both saves resources and extends the life of existing 
antibiotics in combination treatment regimens. Screening of a chemical compound 
library identified BMS-833923 (BMS), a smoothened antagonist, that directly 
kills Gram-positive bacteria and potentiates colistin to destroy various 
Gram-negative bacteria. BMS did not induce detectable antibiotic resistance in 
vitro and showed effective activity against drug-resistant bacteria in vivo. 
Mechanistic studies revealed that BMS caused membrane disruption by targeting 
membrane phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), promoting 
membrane dysfunction, metabolic disturbance, leakage of cellular components, and 
ultimately cell death. The current study describes a potential strategy to 
enhance colistin efficacy and combat multidrug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2023.106888

localization and activity, and include a series of key regulatory proteins, such 
as RAS superfamily members, heterotrimeric G proteins, nuclear lamina protein, 
and several protein kinases and phosphatases. However, studies of prenylated 
proteins in esophageal cancer are limited. Here, through research on large-scale 
proteomic data of esophageal cancer in our laboratory, we found that 
paralemmin-2 (PALM2), a potential prenylated protein, was up-regulated and 
associated with poor prognosis of patients. Low throughput verification showed 
that the expression of PALM2 in esophageal cancer tissues was higher than that 
in their paired normal esophageal epithelial tissues, and it was generally 
expressed in the membrane and cytoplasm of esophageal cancer cells. PALM2 
interacted with the two subunits of farnesyl transferase (FTase), FNTA and FNTB. 
Either addition of an FTase inhibitor or mutation in the CAAX motif of PALM2 
(PALM2C408S) impaired its membranous localization reduced the membrane location 
of PALM2, indicating PALM2 was prenylated by FTase. Overexpression of PALM2 
enhanced the migration of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, 
whereas PALM2C408S lost this ability. Mechanistically, PALM2 interacted with the 
N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family. 
Mutagenesis indicated that lysine residues K253/K254/K262/K263 in ezrin's FERM 
domain and C408 in PALM2's CAAX motif were important for PALM2/ezrin interaction 
and ezrin activation. Knockout of ezrin prevented enhanced cancer cell migration 
by PALM2 overexpression. PALM2, depending on its prenylation, increased both 
ezrin membrane localization and phosphorylation of ezrin at Y146. In summary, 
prenylated PALM2 enhances the migration of cancer cells through activating 
ezrin.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.mcpro.2023.100593

therapy is limited. However, the key factors involved in limiting the efficacy 
of anti-VEGF therapy and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of human leukocyte antigen 
F locus-adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10), a ubiquitin-like protein, in limiting 
the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.
METHODS: FAT10 was knocked out in HCC cells using the clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 
technology. Bevacizumab (BV), an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, was used to 
evaluate the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in vivo. Mechanisms of FAT10 action 
were assessed by RNA sequencing, glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays and 
in vivo ubiquitination assays.
RESULTS: FAT10 accelerated VEGF-independent angiogenesis in HCC cells which 
limited BV efficacy and BV-aggravated hypoxia and inflammation promoted FAT10 
expression. FAT10 overexpression increased levels of proteins involved in 
several signaling pathways in HCC cells, resulting in upregulation of VEGF and 
multiple non-VEGF proangiogenic factors. Upregulation of multiple FAT10-mediated 
non-VEGF signals compensated for the inhibition of VEGF signaling by BV, 
enhancing VEGF-independent angiogenesis and promoting HCC growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preclinical findings identify FAT10 in HCC cells as a key 
factor limiting the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy and elucidate its underlying 
mechanisms. This study provides new mechanistic insights into the development of 
antiangiogenic therapies.",Copyright © 2023. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jare.2023.06.006

It is one of the translational product of expanded G4C2 repeats in the C9orf72 
gene, and its accumulation is contributing to the neuropathogenesis of 
C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia 
(C9-ALS/FTD). In this study, we demonstrate that poly(PR) protein alone is 
sufficient to induce neurodegeneration related to ALS/FTD in cynomolgus monkeys. 
By delivering poly(PR) via AAV, we observed that the PR proteins were located 
within the nucleus of infected cells. The expression of (PR)50 protein, 
consisting of 50 PR repeats, led to increased loss of cortical neurons, 
cytoplasmic lipofuscin, and gliosis in the brain, as well as demyelination and 
loss of ChAT positive neurons in the spinal cord of monkeys. While, these 
pathologies were not observed in monkeys expressing (PR)5, a protein comprising 
only 5 PR repeats. Furthermore, the (PR)50-expressing monkeys exhibited 
progressive motor deficits, cognitive impairment, muscle atrophy, and abnormal 
electromyography (EMG) potentials, which closely resemble clinical symptoms seen 
in C9-ALS/FTD patients. By longitudinally tracking these monkeys, we found that 
changes in cystatin C and chitinase-1 (CHIT1) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) corresponded to the phenotypic progression of (PR)50-induced disease. 
Proteomic analysis revealed that the major clusters of dysregulated proteins 
were nuclear-localized, and downregulation of the MECP2 protein was implicated 
in the toxic process of poly(PR). This research indicates that poly(PR) 
expression alone induces neurodegeneration and core phenotypes associated with 
C9-ALS/FTD in monkeys, which may provide insights into the mechanisms of disease 
pathogenesis.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106197

according to smoking status trajectories using 25-year annually-repeated input, 
traced by group-based trajectory modeling with an extension to account for 
non-random participant attrition or truncation due to death. We examined 2682 
men and 4317 women aged 40 to 59 years who participated in annual health checks 
for the community-based prospective cohort study, 1975-1984 enrollment in Japan. 
The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality (follow-up period: median 
30.2 years in men and 32.2 years in women). We traced annual smoking 
trajectories, stratified by sex and smoking status at baseline. For smokers at 
baseline, we identified five trajectories in both sexes, with different patterns 
of smoking cessation (e.g., early quitters and lifelong smokers). We calculated 
HRs and 95% CI of all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression 
modeling adjusted for age, body mass index, alcohol intake, blood pressure 
category, dyslipidemia and glucose category. Compared with one-time-point-based 
smokers, trajectory-based lifelong smokers had an increased risk of all-cause 
mortality; HRs were 1.31 (95% CI, 1.18-1.46) in men and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.91-1.73) 
in women. Among community residents aged 40 to 59 years, 
25-year-trajectory-based lifelong smokers had an approximately 30% increased 
risk for all-cause mortality compared to one-time-point-based smokers. Risk of 
all-cause mortality among smokers with earlier cessation varied materially. It 
is necessary to consider the trajectories of smoking status to clarify the

prognosis in patients with HPV positive (HPV + ve) head & neck squamous cell 
carcinomas (HNSCC) compared to HPV negative (HPV-ve) HNSCC and develop molecular 
markers for selection of HPV + ve HNSCC patients for treatment de-escalation 
trials.
METHODS: NRF2 activity (NRF2, KEAP1, and NRF2-transcriptional targets), p16, and 
p53 levels between HPV + ve HNSCC and HPV-ve HNSCC in prospective and 
retrospective tumor samples as well as from TCGA database were compared. Cancer 
cells were transfected with HPV-E6/E7 plasmid to elucidate if HPV infection 
represses NRF2 activity and sensitizes to chemo-radiotherapy.
RESULTS: Prospective analysis revealed a marked reduction in expression of NRF2, 
and its downstream genes in HPV + ve tumors compared to HPV-ve tumors. A 
retrospective analysis by IHC revealed significantly lower NQO1 in p16high 
tumors compared to p16low tumors and the NQO1 expression correlated negatively 
with p16 and positively with p53. Analysis of the TCGA database confirmed low 
constitutive NRF2 activity in HPV + ve HNSCC compared to HPV-ve HNSCC and 
revealed that HPV + ve HNSCC patients with 'low NQO1' expression showed better 
overall survival compared to HPV + ve HNSCC patients with 'high NQO1' 
expression. Ectopic expression of HPV-E6/E7 plasmid in various cancer cells 
repressed constitutive NRF2 activity, reduced total GSH, increased ROS levels, 
and sensitized the cancer cells to cisplatin and ionizing radiation.
CONCLUSION: Low constitutive NRF2 activity contributes to better prognosis of 
HPV + ve HNSCC patients. Co-expression of p16high, NQO1low, and p53low could 
serve as a predictive biomarker for the selection of HPV + ve HNSCC patients for 
de-escalation trials.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2023.06.011

prostate (HoLEP) using a large real-world cohort. We compare the safety, 
readmission, and retreatment rates of HoLEP to other widely used endoscopic 
surgical interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) including 
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), photoselective vaporization of 
the prostate (PVP), and prostatic urethral lift (PUL).
METHODS: Men who underwent endoscopic treatments for BPH from 2000-2019 were 
identified in the Premier Healthcare Database (n=218,793). We compared the 
relative proportion of each procedure performed and annual physician volume data 
to identify trends in adoption and utilization. Readmission and retreatment 
rates were determined at both 30- and 90- days post-operation. Multivariable 
logistic regression was used to assess the association between procedure type 
and outcomes.
RESULTS: HoLEP accounted for 3.2% (n=6,967) of all BPH procedures performed 
between 2000 and 2019 and increased from 1.1% of procedures in 2008 to 4% in 
2019. Patients undergoing HoLEP had a lower odds of 90-day readmission compared 
to TURP (OR 0.87, p=0.025). HoLEP had similar odds of retreatment compared to 
TURP at both 1- year (OR 0.96, p=0.7) and 2-years (OR 0.98, p=0.9), while 
patients undergoing PVP and PUL were more likely to be retreated within 2-years 
(OR 1.20, p<0.001; OR 1.87, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: HoLEP is a safe therapy for BPH with lower readmission and 
comparable retreatment rates to the gold standard TURP. Despite this, the 
utilization of HoLEP has lagged behind other endoscopic procedures and remains 
low.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.urology.2023.05.028

estimate the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP). The aim of this study was to 
externally validate the most frequently used prediction models for RP, i.e., the 
QUANTEC and APPELT models, in a large cohort of lung cancer patients treated 
with IMRT or VMAT. [1-2] METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective cohort study, 
included lung cancer patients treated between 2013 and 2018 . A closed testing 
procedure was performed to test the need for model updating. To improve model 
performance, modification or removal of variables was considered. Performance 
measures included tests for goodness of fit, discrimination, and calibration.
RESULTS: In this cohort of 612 patients, the incidence of RP ≥ grade 2 was 
14.5%. For the QUANTEC-model, recalibration was recommended which resulted in a 
revised intercept and adjusted regression coefficient (from 0.126 to 0.224) of 
the mean lung dose (MLD),. The APPELT-model needed revision including model 
updating with modification and elimination of variables. After revision, the New 
RP-model included the following predictors (and regression coefficients): MLD 
(B=0.250), age (B=0.049 , and smoking status (B=0.902). The discrimination of 
the updated APPELT-model was higher compared to the recalibrated QUANTEC-model 
(AUC: 0.79 vs. 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that both the QUANTEC- and APPELT-model 
needed revision. Next to changes of the intercept and regression coefficients, 
the APPELT model improved further by model updating and performed better than 
the recalibrated QUANTEC model. This New RP-model is widely applicable 
containing non-tumour site specific variables, which can easily be collected.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.radonc.2023.109735

keratocyst (POKC) of the gingiva, report an unusual presentation, and discuss 
lesional recurrence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the English language literature for gingival 
OKCs was conducted. The inclusion of new case yielded a database containing 29 
affected patients. Clinical, surgical, radiographic, and histopathologic 
findings have been summarized.
RESULTS: With available patient demographics, 62.5 % were female and 37.5% were 
male, with an overall mean age at diagnosis of 53.8 years. There was near-equal 
lesional affinity for the jaws, of which 44.0% occurred in the posterior region, 
32.0% anteriorly, and 24.0% overlapped these areas. Twenty-five percent of 
lesions had a normal color, 30.0% appeared yellow, 20.0% were white, 10.0% were 
blue. The majority of lesions were < 1 cm and nearly 42% manifested exudation or 
fluctuance. Lesional pain was infrequent. Pressure resorption was recorded in 
45.8% of cases. Most lesions were managed with conservative surgical modalities. 
Follow-up information was available in 16 primary cases, of which 5 recurred, 
signifying a 31.3% recurrence rate, including the featured case, which recurred 
twice.
CONCLUSION: To reduce recurrence of a gingival OKC, supraperiosteal dissection 
is advocated. Further, it is advised to follow POKCs for 5-7 years 
postoperatively, remaining vigilant for subtle clinical manifestations of 
recurrence. Timely discovery and excision of a POKC of the gingiva may decrease 
the incidence of a mucogingival defect.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jormas.2023.101540

promote early detection and treatment. Understanding the determinants of PCa 
screening uptake would help policy makers to identify high-risk populations and 
ensure the cost-effectiveness of health promotion interventions. This study aims 
to estimate the prevalence of PCa screening uptake and assess its associated 
factors among Kenyan men.
METHODS: The study relied on data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health 
Survey. Both descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. Firth logistic 
regression was employed using the ""firthlogit"" command in STATA. The adjusted 
odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were presented.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of PCa screening uptake was 4.4%. The odds of 
PCa screening uptake were high among men aged 50-54 [aOR=2.08; CI=1.23, 3.52], 
those who had health insurance coverage [aOR=1.69; CI=1.28, 2.23], those who 
read at least once in a week [aOR=1.52; CI=1.10, 2.10], and among those who 
watched TV at least once in a week [aOR=1.73; CI=1.18, 2.52]. Men who resided in 
the Eastern [aOR=2.23; CI=1.39, 3.60], Nyanza [aOR=2.13; CI=1.29, 3.53], and 
Nairobi [aOR=1.97; CI=1.01, 3.86] had a higher likelihood of getting screened 
for PCa.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the uptake of PCa screening in Kenya is low. To 
ensure the cost-effectiveness of health-promoting interventions that aim to 
improve PCa screening uptake in Kenya, men without health insurance coverage 
should be targeted and prioritized. Increasing literacy rate, sensitization via 
television, and increasing the insurance coverage in the country would 
significantly contribute to a higher uptake of PCa screening.
POLICY SUMMARY: To improve the uptake of PCa screening, there would be a need to 
implement a national advocacy campaign that will sensitize Kenyan men about the 
need to undergo PCa screening. This national advocacy campaign to increase the 
uptake of PCa screening in Kenya must leverage mass media platforms.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jcpo.2023.100427

of bone of the spine (SPBS) was rarely detected in the past. However, its 
incidence has gradually increased with improvements in the diagnosis and 
understanding of the disease. We aimed to conduct a population-based cohort 
study to characterize the prevalence and factors associated with SPBS and 
develop a prognostic nomogram for predicting the overall survival of SPBS 
patients with a real-world analysis based on the surveillance, epidemiology, and 
end results (SEER) database.
METHODS: Patients with SPBS at diagnosis were identified using the SEER database 
from 2000 to 2018. Multivariable and univariate logistic regression analyses 
were used to identify factors for developing a novel nomogram. Nomogram 
performance was evaluated using the calibration curve, area under the curve 
(AUC), and decision curve analyses. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate 
survival durations.
RESULTS: A total of 1147 patients were selected for survival analysis. 
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictors for SPBS were as

their long-term health effects, including childhood leukaemia, remain elusive. 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified the exposure to 
magnetic fields >0.4 μT as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2 B)' for 
childhood leukaemia. However, the number of exposed individuals, particularly 
children, remains poorly documented in international literature. The objective 
of this study was to estimate the number of individuals living near a high or 
very high voltage line in France (≥63 kV), among the general population and 
children under the age of five years.
METHODS: The estimate considered different exposure scenarios depending on the 
line voltage and the distance of the housing from it, and whether the line is 
overhead or underground. The exposure scenarios were obtained using a multilevel 
linear model created from a measurement database published by ""Réseau de 
transport d'électricité"", the operator of the French electricity transmission 
network.
RESULTS: Between 0.11% (n = 67,893) and 1.01% (n = 647,569) of the French 
population and between 0.10% (n = 4712) and 1.03% (n = 46,950) of children under 
five years of age were estimated to be living in an area potentially exposed to 
a magnetic field, depending on the exposure scenario (>0.4 μT and >0.1 μT, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: By making it possible to estimate the total number of residents, 
schools, and health institutions near high-voltage power lines, the proposed 
methodology can help identify potential co-exposures near high-voltage power 
lines, which are regularly cited as a possible explanation for contradictory 
results from epidemiological studies.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.envres.2023.116425

utilisation of older patients with cancer and whether this is associated with 
geriatric screening results. We aimed to evaluate long-term health-care 
utilisation among older patients after cancer diagnosis and the association with 
baseline Geriatric 8 (G8) screening results.
METHODS: For this retrospective analysis, we included data from three cohort 
studies for patients (aged ≥70 years) with a new cancer diagnosis who underwent 
G8 screening between Oct 19, 2009 and Feb 27, 2015, and who survived more than 3 
months after G8 screening. The clinical data were linked to cancer registry and 
health-care reimbursement data for long-term follow-up. The occurrence of 
outcomes (inpatient hospital admissions, emergency department visits, use of 
intensive care, contacts with general practitioner [GP], contacts with a 
specialist, use of home care, and nursing home admissions) was assessed in the 3 
years after G8 screening. We assessed the association between outcomes and 
baseline G8 score (normal score [>14] or abnormal [≤14]) using adjusted rate 
ratios (aRRs) calculated from Poisson regression and using cumulative incidence 
calculated as a time-to-event analysis with the Kaplan-Meier method.
FINDINGS: 7556 patients had a new cancer diagnosis, of whom 6391 patients 
(median age 77 years [IQR 74-82]) met inclusion criteria and were included. 4110 
(64·3%) of 6391 patients had an abnormal baseline G8 score (≤14 of 17 points). 
In the first 3 months after G8 screening, health-care utilisation peaked and 
then decreased over time, with the exception of GP contacts and home care days, 
which remained high throughout the 3-year follow-up period. Compared with 
patients with a normal baseline G8 score, patients with an abnormal baseline G8 
score had more hospital admissions (aRR 1·20 [95% CI 1·15-1·25]; p<0·0001), 
hospital days (1·66 [1·64-1·68]; p<0·0001), emergency department visits (1·42 
[1·34-1·52]; p<0·0001), intensive care days (1·49 [1·39-1·60]; p<0·0001), 
general practitioner contacts (1·19 [1·17-1·20]; p<0·0001), home care days (1·59 
[1·58-1·60]; p<0·0001), and nursing home admissions (16·7% vs 3·1%; p<0·0001) in 
the 3-year follow-up period. At 3 years, of the 2281 patients with a normal 
baseline G8 score, 1421 (62·3%) continued to live at home independently and 503 
(22·0%) had died. Of the 4110 patients with an abnormal baseline G8 score, 1057 
(25·7%) continued to live at home independently and 2191 (53·3%) had died.
INTERPRETATION: An abnormal G8 score at cancer diagnosis was associated with 
increased health-care utilisation in the subsequent 3 years among patients who 
survived longer than 3 months.

development and is associated with altered DNA methylation signatures, which 
might be more common in children exposed during sensitive periods in 
development. However, it remains unclear whether adversity has persistent 
epigenetic associations across childhood and adolescence. We aimed to examine 
the relationship between time-varying adversity (defined through sensitive 
period, accumulation of risk, and recency life course hypotheses) and 
genome-wide DNA methylation, measured three times from birth to adolescence, 
using data from a prospective, longitudinal cohort study.
METHODS: We first investigated the relationship between the timing of exposure 
to childhood adversity between birth and 11 years and blood DNA methylation at 
age 15 years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) 
prospective cohort study. Our analytic sample included ALSPAC participants with 
DNA methylation data and complete childhood adversity data between birth and 11 
years. We analysed seven types of adversity (caregiver physical or emotional 
abuse, sexual or physical abuse [by anyone], maternal psychopathology, one-adult 
households, family instability, financial hardship, and neighbourhood 
disadvantage) reported by mothers five to eight times between birth and 11 
years. We used the structured life course modelling approach (SLCMA) to identify 
time-varying associations between childhood adversity and adolescent DNA 
methylation. Top loci were identified using an R2 threshold of 0·035 (ie, ≥3·5% 
of DNA methylation variance explained by adversity). We attempted to replicate 
these associations using data from the Raine Study and Future of Families and 
Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). We also assessed the persistence of adversity-DNA 
methylation associations we previously identified from age 7 blood DNA 
methylation into adolescence and the influence of adversity on DNA methylation 
trajectories from ages 0-15 years.
FINDINGS: Of 13 988 children in the ALSPAC cohort, 609-665 children (311-337 
[50-51%] boys and 298-332 [49-50%] girls) had complete data available for at 
least one of the seven childhood adversities and DNA methylation at 15 years. 
Exposure to adversity was associated with differences in DNA methylation at 15 
years for 41 loci (R2 ≥0·035). Sensitive periods were the most often selected 
life course hypothesis by the SLCMA. 20 (49%) of 41 loci were associated with 
adversities occurring between age 3 and 5 years. Exposure to one-adult 
households was associated with differences in DNA methylation at 20 [49%] of 41 
loci, exposure to financial hardship was associated with changes at nine (22%) 
loci, and physical or sexual abuse was associated with changes at four (10%) 
loci. We replicated the direction of associations for 18 (90%) of 20 loci 
associated with exposure to one-adult household using adolescent blood DNA 
methylation from the Raine Study and 18 (64%) of 28 loci using saliva DNA 
methylation from the FFCWS. The directions of effects for 11 one-adult household 
loci were replicated in both cohorts. Differences in DNA methylation at 15 years 
were not present at 7 years and differences identified at 7 years were no longer 
apparent by 15 years. We also identified six distinct DNA methylation 
trajectories from these patterns of stability and persistence.
INTERPRETATION: These findings highlight the time-varying effect of childhood 
adversity on DNA methylation profiles across development, which might link 
exposure to adversity to potential adverse health outcomes in children and 
adolescents. If replicated, these epigenetic signatures could ultimately serve 
as biological indicators or early warning signs of initiated disease processes, 
helping identify people at greater risk for the adverse health consequences of 
childhood adversity.

during ultrasound poroelastography (USPE) experiments are correlated with two 
markers of cancer growth and treatment effectiveness: growth-induced solid 
stress (SSg) and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). The spatio-temporal 
distributions of SSg and IFP are determined by the transport properties of the 
vessels and interstitium in the tumor microenvironment. &#xD;Approach. We 
propose a new USPE method for the non-invasive imaging of the local cancer 
mechanical parameters and dynamics of fluid flow. When performing 
poroelastography experiments, it may be difficult to implement a typical creep 
compression protocol, which requires to maintain a constant normally applied 
force. In this paper, we investigate the use of a stress relaxation protocol, 
which might be a more convenient choice for clinical poroelastography 
applications. &#xD;Main results. Based on our finite element (FE) and ultrasound 
(US) simulations study, we demonstrate that the SSc, FPc and their 
spatio-temporal distribution related parameters, interstitial permeability (IP) 
and vascular permeability (VP), can be determined from stress relaxation 
experiments with errors below 10% as compared to the ground truth and accuracy 
similar to that of corresponding creep tests, respectively. We also demonstrate 
the feasibility of the new methodology for in vivo experiments using a small 
animal cancer model.

individuals have variably decreased global pigmentation and visual-developmental 
changes that lead to low vision. OCA is notable for significant missing 
heritability, particularly among individuals with residual pigmentation. 
Tyrosinase (TYR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin pigment biosynthesis and 
mutations that decrease enzyme function are one of the most common causes of 
OCA. We present the analysis of high-depth short-read TYR sequencing data for a 
cohort of 352 OCA probands, ∼50% of whom were previously sequenced without 
yielding a definitive diagnostic result. Our analysis identified 66 TYR 
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletions (indels), 3 
structural variants, and a rare haplotype comprised of two common frequency 
variants (p.Ser192Tyr and p.Arg402Gln) in cis-orientation, present in 149/352 
OCA probands. We further describe a detailed analysis of the disease-causing 
haplotype, p.[Ser192Tyr; Arg402Gln] (""cis-YQ""). Haplotype analysis suggests that 
the cis-YQ allele arose by recombination and that multiple cis-YQ haplotypes are 
segregating in OCA-affected individuals and control populations. The cis-YQ 
allele is the most common disease-causing allele in our cohort, representing 
19.1% (57/298) of TYR pathogenic alleles in individuals with type 1 
(TYR-associated) OCA. Finally, among the 66 TYR variants, we found several 
additional alleles defined by a cis-oriented combination of minor, potentially 
hypomorph-producing alleles at common variant sites plus a second, rare 
pathogenic variant. Together, these results suggest that identification of 
phased variants for the full TYR locus are required for an exhaustive assessment 
for potentially disease-causing alleles.",Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.05.012

chromatin domains, whose contribution to tumorigenesis is uncertain. Through 
high-resolution genome-wide single-cell DNA methylation sequencing, we identify 
40 core domains that are uniformly hypomethylated from the earliest detectable 
stages of prostate malignancy through metastatic circulating tumor cells (CTCs). 
Nested among these repressive domains are smaller loci with preserved 
methylation that escape silencing and are enriched for cell proliferation genes. 
Transcriptionally silenced genes within the core hypomethylated domains are 
enriched for immune-related genes; prominent among these is a single gene 
cluster harboring all five CD1 genes that present lipid antigens to NKT cells 
and four IFI16-related interferon-inducible genes implicated in innate immunity. 
The re-expression of CD1 or IFI16 murine orthologs in immuno-competent mice 
abrogates tumorigenesis, accompanied by the activation of anti-tumor immunity. 
Thus, early epigenetic changes may shape tumorigenesis, targeting co-located 
genes within defined chromosomal loci. Hypomethylation domains are detectable in

closed chromatin. OCT4 is a crucial pioneer factor that can induce cell 
reprogramming. However, the structural basis of how pioneer factors recognize 
the in vivo nucleosomal DNA targets is unknown. Here, we determine the 
high-resolution structures of the nucleosome containing human LIN28B DNA and its 
complexes with the OCT4 DNA binding region. Three OCT4s bind the pre-positioned 
nucleosome by recognizing non-canonical DNA sequences. Two use their POUS 
domains while the other uses the POUS-loop-POUHD region; POUHD serves as a wedge 
to unwrap ∼25 base pair DNA. Our analysis of previous genomic data and 
determination of the ESRRB-nucleosome-OCT4 structure confirmed the generality of 
these structural features. Moreover, biochemical studies suggest that multiple 
OCT4s cooperatively open the H1-condensed nucleosome array containing the LIN28B 
nucleosome. Thus, our study suggests a mechanism of how OCT4 can target the

exponentially worldwide, and a similar trend has also been noted in India. The 
Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) strongly correlates the presence of 
individual comorbidities with mortality, and the Onco-MPI prognosticates 
patients accurately for overall mortality. However, limited studies have 
evaluated this index in patient populations beyond Italy. We evaluated the 
performance of the Onco-MPI index in predicting mortality in older Indian 
patients with cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational study was conducted between October 
2019 and November 2021 in the Geriatric Oncology Clinic at Tata Memorial 
Hospital in Mumbai, India. The data of patients aged ≥60 years with solid tumors 
who underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment was analysed. The study's 
primary aim was to calculate the Onco-MPI for patients in the study and 
correlate it with one-year mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 576 patients aged ≥60 years were included in the study. The 
median age (range) of the population was 68 (60-90) years, and 429 (74.5%) were 
male. After a median follow-up of 19.2 months, 366 (63.7%) patients had died. 
The proportion of patients classified as low risk (0-0.46), moderate risk 
(0.47-0.63) and high risk (0.64-1.0) were 38% (219 patients), 37% (211 patients) 
and 25% (145 patients), respectively. There was a significant difference in 
one-year mortality rates between the low-risk patients compared to medium and 
high-risk patients (40.6% vs 53.1% vs 71.7%; p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: The current study validates the Onco-MPI as a predictive tool for 
estimating short-term mortality in older Indian patients with cancer. Further 
prospective studies need to build on this index to obtain a score with greater 
discrimination in the Indian population.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101550

goals of care and an evidence-based treatment course commensurate with patient 
goals. This feasibility study assessed the utility of an electronic tablet-based 
questionnaire to elicit patient goals, preferences, and concerns at a treatment 
decision making time point in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients were recruited from three 
institutions prior to seeing the physician for treatment decision-making visit. 
Questionnaires included demographics, patient beliefs, and decision-making 
preferences. Analyses included standard descriptive statistics appropriate for 
the level of measurement.
RESULTS: Median age was 71 (range = 61-88), 64.9% female, 87.0% white, and 48.6% 
college educated. On average, patients completed the surveys unassisted in 
16.24 min and providers reviewed the dashboard in 3.5 min. All but one patient 
completed the survey prior to starting treatment (98.7%). Providers reviewed the 
survey results prior to seeing the patient 97.4% of the time. When asked their 
goals of care, 57 (74.0%) patients agreed with the statement ""my cancer is 
curable"" and 75 (97.4%) agreed that the treatment goal was to get rid of all 
cancer. Seventy-seven (100%) agreed the goal of care is to feel better and 76 
(98.7%) agreed the goal of care is live longer. Forty-one (53.9%) indicated they 
wanted to make treatment decisions together with the provider. The top two 
concerns were understanding treatment options (n = 24; 31.2%) and making the 
right decision (n = 22; 28.6%).
DISCUSSION: This pilot demonstrated the feasibility of using technology for 
decision-making at the point of care. Eliciting patient goals of care, treatment 
outcomes expectations, decision-making preferences, and top concerns may provide 
clinicians with information to inform the treatment discussion. A simple 
electronic tool may provide valuable insight into patient understanding of 
disease to better tailor patient-provider discussion and treatment 
decision-making.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101555

segmentation, while CBR gives an explainable and accurate classification. The

diagnosis. However, the issue of increased cancer risk due to radiation exposure 
has raised public concern. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) technique is a CT 
scan with lower radiation dose than conventional scans. LDCT is used to make a 
diagnosis of lesions with the smallest dose of x-rays, and is currently mainly 
used for early lung cancer screening. However, LDCT has severe image noise, and 
these noises affect adversely the quality of medical images and thus the 
diagnosis of lesions. In this paper, we propose a novel LDCT image denoising 
method based on transformer combined with convolutional neural network (CNN). 
The encoder part of the network is based on CNN, which is mainly used to extract 
the image detail information. In the decoder part, we propose a dual-path 
transformer block (DPTB), which extracts the features of input of the skip 
connection and the features of input of the previous level through two paths 
respectively. DPTB can better restore the detail and structure information of 
the denoised image. In order to pay more attention to the key regions of the 
feature images extracted at the shallow level of the network, we also propose a 
multi-feature spatial attention block (MSAB) in the skip connection part. 
Experimental studies are conducted, and comparisons with the state-of-the-art 
networks are made, and the results demonstrate that the developed method can 
effectively remove the noise in CT images and improve the image quality in the 
evaluation metrics of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity 
(SSIM), and root mean square error (RMSE) and is superior to the 
state-of-the-art models. Our method achieved 28.9720 of PSNR, 0.8595 of SSIM and 
14.8657 of RMSE on the Mayo Clinic LDCT Grand Challenge dataset. For different 
noise level σ (15, 35, and 55) on the QIN_LUNG_CT dataset, our proposed also 
achieved better performances.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107162

cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) damages, which predominantly form at TpT 
(thymine-thymine) steps. It is well known that CPD damage probability is 
different for single-stranded or double stranded DNA and depends on the sequence 
context. However, DNA deformation due to packing in nucleosomes can also 
influence CPD formation. Quantum mechanical calculations and Molecular Dynamics 
simulations indicate little CPD damage probability for DNA's equilibrium 
structure. We find that DNA needs to be deformed in a specific way to allow the 
HOMO → LUMO transition required for CPD damage formation. The simulation studies 
further show that the periodic CPD damage patterns measured in chromosomes and 
nucleosomes can be directly explained by the periodic deformation pattern of the 
DNA in the nucleosome complex. It supports previous findings on characteristic 
deformation patterns found in experimental nucleosome structures that relate to 
CPD damage formation. The result may have important implications for our

consistent with the mechanisms of asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine to 
aspartic acid and ammonia, and secondarily converts glutamine to glutamate and 
ammonia. However, there are only a few reports on the treatment of these 
patients, which varies widely from watchful waiting to treatment with lactulose, 
protein restriction, sodium benzoate, and phenylbutyrate to dialysis. While many 
patients with reported asparaginase-induced hyperammonemia (AIH) are 
asymptomatic, some have severe complications and even fatal outcomes despite 
medical intervention. Here, we present a cohort of five pediatric patients with 
symptomatic AIH, which occurred after switching patients from polyethylene 
glycolated (PEG)- asparaginase to recombinant Crisantaspase Pseudomonas 
fluorescens (4 patients) or Erwinia (1 patient) asparaginase, and discuss their 
subsequent management, metabolic workup, and genetic testing. We developed an 
institutional management plan, which gradually evolved based on our local 
experience and previous treatment modalities. Because of the significant 
reduction in glutamine levels after asparaginase administration, sodium benzoate 
should be used as a first-line ammonia scavenger for symptomatic AIH instead of 
sodium phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate. This approach facilitated continuation 
of asparaginase doses, which is known to improve cancer outcomes. We also 
discuss the potential contribution of genetic modifiers to AIH. Our data 
highlights the need for increased awareness of symptomatic AIH, especially when 
an asparaginase with higher glutaminase activity is used, and its prompt 
management. The utility and efficacy of this management approach should be 
systematically investigated in a larger cohort of patients.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ymgme.2023.107627

care, such as the emergency department (ED). Although most studies have 
investigated this association among patients with insurance, few have done so 
for patients without insurance. We used data from a free clinic network to 
assess the association between free clinic use and intent to use the ED.
METHODS: Data were collected from a free clinic network's electronic health 
records on adult patients from January 2015 to February 2020. Our outcome was 
whether patients reported themselves as 'very likely' to visit the ED if the 
free clinics were unavailable. The independent variable was frequency of free 
clinic use. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, we controlled for 
other factors, such as patient demographic factors, social determinants of 
health, health status, and year effect.
RESULTS: Our sample included 5008 visits. When controlling for other factors, 
higher odds of expressing ED interest were observed for patients who are 
non-Hispanic Black, older, not married, lived with others, had lower education, 
were homeless, had personal transportation, lived in rural areas, and had a 
higher comorbidity burden. In sensitivity analyses, higher odds were observed 
for dental, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, or respiratory 
conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: In the free clinic space, several patient demographic, social 
determinants of health and medical conditions were independently associated with 
greater odds of reporting intent on visiting the ED. Additional interventions 
that improve access and use of free clinics (e.g., dental) may keep patients 
without insurance from the ED.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ajem.2023.06.003

form a microthrombus protective barrier around them, so that therapeutic drugs 
and immune cells cannot effectively kill CTCs. The platelet membrane (PM) bionic 
carrying drug system has the powerful ability of immune escape, and can 
circulate in the blood for a long time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: we developed platelet membrane coated nanoparticles (PM 
HMSNs) to improve the precise delivery of drugs to tumor sites and to achieve 
more effective immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy strategy.
RESULTS: Successfully prepared aPD-L1-PM-SO@HMSNs particles, whose diameter is 
95-130 nm and presenting the same surface protein as PM. Laser confocal 
microscopy and flow cytometry experimental results showed that the fluorescence 
intensity of aPD-L1-PM-SO@HMSNs was greater than SO@HMSNs that are not coated by 
PM. Biodistribution studies in H22 tumor-bearing mice showed that due to the 
combined action of the active targeting effect and the EPR effect, the high 
accumulation of aPD-L1-PM-SO@HMSNs in the local tumor was more effective in 
inhibiting tumor growth than other groups of therapeutic agents.
CONCLUSION: Platelet membrane biomimetic nanoparticles have a good targeted 
therapeutic effect, which can effectively avoid immune clearance and have little 
side effects. It provides a new direction and theoretical basis for further 
research on targeted therapy of CTCs in liver cancer.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.05.124

agents are standard treatments for patients with HER2-positive breast and 
gastric cancer. Herein, we report the results of an open-label, single-center, 
phase II basket trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab 
biosimilar (Samfenet®) plus treatment of physician's choice for patients with 
previously treated HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, along with biomarker 
analysis employing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing.
METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic non-breast, 
non-gastric solid tumors who failed at least one prior treatment were included 
in this study conducted at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Patients received 
trastuzumab combined with irinotecan or gemcitabine at the treating physicians' 
discretion. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate as per RECIST 
version 1.1. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and at the time of 
disease progression for ctDNA analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were screened from 31 December 2019 to 17 
September 2021, and 20 were enrolled in this study. Their median age was 64 
years (30-84 years), and 13 patients (65.0%) were male. The most common primary 
tumor was hepatobiliary cancer (seven patients, 35.0%), followed by colorectal 
cancer (six patients, 30.0%). Among 18 patients with an available response 
evaluation, the objective response rate was 11.1% (95% confidence interval 3.1% 
to 32.8%). ERBB2 amplification was detected from ctDNA analysis of baseline 
plasma samples in 85% of patients (n = 17), and the ERBB2 copy number from ctDNA 
analysis showed a significant correlation with the results from tissue 
sequencing. Among 16 patients with post-progression ctDNA analysis, 7 (43.8%) 
developed new alterations. None of the patients discontinued the study due to 
adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab plus irinotecan or gemcitabine was safe and feasible 
for patients with previously treated HER2-positive advanced solid tumors with 
modest efficacy outcomes, and ctDNA analysis was useful for detecting HER2 
amplification.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.esmoop.2023.101583

immunotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma patients has zeroed in on genes in the 
switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) pathway. The mutational profiles of key 
genes are not clearly defined, however, and no comparisons have been conducted 
on whether mutations in the genes involved provide the same predictive value.
METHODS: In this study, analysis of clinical factors, tumor mutation burden 
(TMB), chromosomal instability, and co-alterations was conducted for 4344 lung 
adenocarcinoma samples. Independent online cohorts (N = 1661 and 576) were used 
to supplement the analysis with survival and RNA-seq data.
RESULTS: Mutational burden and chromosomal instability analysis showed that ARID 
family mutations (including ARID1A, ARID1B, or ARID2 mutations) and SMARC family 
mutations (including SMARCA4 or SMARCB1 mutations) display different profiles 
from wild-type (WT) samples (TMB: ARID versus WT: P < 2.2 × 10-16, SMARC versus 
WT: P < 2.2 × 10-16; CIN: ARID versus WT: P = 1.8 × 10-5, SMARC versus WT: P = 
0.027). Both mutant groups have a higher proportion of transversions than 
transitions, whereas the ratio is more equal for wild-type samples. Survival 
analysis shows that patients with ARID mutations were more sensitive to 
immunotherapy treatment than wild-type and SMARC-mutated patients (P < 0.001 and 
P = 0.013, respectively), and multivariate Cox analysis reveals that the 
presence of ARID mutations is likely the main cause.
CONCLUSIONS: The research presented in this study shows that mutations in the 
ARID gene family, including ARID1A, ARID1B, and ARID2, are primarily responsible 
for the sensitive response to immunotherapy treatment in patients with lung 
adenocarcinoma.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.esmoop.2023.101585

patients with various malignancies. However, the uncontrolled growth and 
metastatic infiltration of malignant tumours remain a huge therapeutic 
challenge. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an integrated multifunctional 
diagnostic and treatment reagent IR-251 that can not only be used for tumour 
imaging but also to inhibit tumour growth and metastasis. Besides, our results 
showed that IR-251 targeted and damaged the mitochondria in cancer cells via 
organic anion-transporting polypeptides. Mechanistically, IR-251 induced ROS 
overproduction by inhibiting PPARγ and then inhibiting the β-catenin signalling 
pathway and downstream protein molecules related to the cell cycle and 
metastasis. Moreover, the excellent anti-tumour proliferation and metastasis 
ability of IR-251 were verified in vitro/in vivo. And histochemistry staining 
revealed that IR-251 inhibited tumour proliferation and metastasis, which showed 
no significant side effect. In conclusion, this novel, multifunctional, 
mitochondria-targeting near-infrared fluorophore probe IR-251 has great

early stage of the cancer. Ultrasensitive detection of the changes of methylated 
DNA offers possibility for early diagnosis of cancer. In this work, a tannic 
acid-accelerated Fenton chemical reaction amplification was firstly proposed for 
the construction of ultrasensitive fluorescent assay. Tannic acid was used as 
reductant to accelerate Fenton reaction procedure through the conversion of 
Fe3+/Fe2+, generating hydroxyl radicals (·OH) continuously. The produced ·OH 
oxidized massive non-fluorescent terephthalic acid (TA) to fluorescent-emitting 
hydroxy terephthalic acid (TAOH). In this way, the fluorescent signal could be 
greatly enhanced and the sensitivity was improved almost 116 times. The proposed 
signal amplification strategy was further applied to detect of DNA methylation 
with the assistance of liposome encapsulated with tannic-Fe3+ complexes. The 
methylated DNA was firstly captured through the hybridization with its 
complementary DNA that were pre-modified in the 96-well plate via the 
combination between streptavidin (SA) and biotin. Then, 5 mC antibody on the 
surface of liposomes specially recognized and combined with methylation sites, 
which brought large amount of tannic-Fe3+ complexes to participate Fenton 
reaction. The fluorescence of generated TAOH was depended on the concentration 
of methylated DNA. The assay showed good analytical performance for methylated 
DNA with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.4 fM. It's believed that tannic 
acid-accelerated Fenton chemical reaction amplification strategy provides a 
promising platform for ultrasensitive fluorescent detection of low abundant

reported for CD44-targeted delivery of photosensitizers (chlorin e6, Ce6) for 
diagnostic imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancers. Through the use of 
a hypoxia-responsive cross-linker (AZO-CDI), the HANGs were prepared by 
chemically cross-linking primary amine groups-functionalized hyaluronic acid 
(HA). Under normoxic condition, fluorescence of Ce6 conjugated on the HANGs was 
highly quenched, and level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the 
HANGs was rather low after laser irradiation. However, under hypoxic condition, 
the HANGs underwent rapid disassociation, and fluorescence of Ce6 conjugated on 
the HANGs was recovered, triggering high-level singlet oxygen generation after 
laser irradiation. Due to the presence of HA, the HANGs showed much higher 
cellular uptake by CD44-positive cancer cells (A549 cells) than that by 
CD44-negative cancer cells (HepG2 cells). In addition, the HANGs could generate 
higher level of ROS in A549 cells because of improved cancer cell uptake. This 
excellent tumor-targeting and singlet oxygen-generating ability of the HANGs was 
favorable to hypoxia-activated PDT of CD44-positive cancers with significant

that is overexpressed in breast cancer (BC) and promotes tumor progression. 
Sculponeatin A (stA), a new diterpenoid extracted from Isodon sculponeatus, has 
no reported antitumor mechanism.
PURPOSE: Here, we explored the antitumor activity of stA in BC and further 
clarified its mechanism.
METHODS: Ferroptosis was detected by flow cytometric, glutathione, 
malondialdehyde, and iron determination assays. The effect of stA on the 
upstream signaling pathway of ferroptosis was detected by Western blot, gene 
expression, gene alterations and other approaches. The binding of stA and ETS1 
was examined through a microscale thermophoresis assay and a drug affinity 
responsive target stability assay. An in vivo mouse model experiment was 
performed to evaluate the therapeutic and potential mechanism of stA.
RESULTS: stA exhibits therapeutic potential in BC by inducing 
SLC7A11/xCT-dependent ferroptosis. stA decreases the expression of ETS1, which 
is responsible for xCT-dependent ferroptosis in BC. stA inhibits the 
transcriptional expression of xCT by directly binding to the ETS domain of the 
ETS1 protein. In addition, stA promotes proteasomal degradation of ETS1 by 
triggering ubiquitin ligase synoviolin 1 (SYVN1)-mediated ubiquitination. The 
K318 site of ETS1 mediates ubiquitination of ETS1 by SYVN1. In a mouse model, 
stA inhibits tumor growth without causing obvious toxicity.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results confirm that stA promotes the ETS1-SYVN1 
interaction to induce ferroptosis in BC mediated by ETS1 degradation. stA is 
expected to be used in research of candidate drugs for BC and drug design based 
on ETS1 degradation.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier GmbH.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154921

body radiation therapy (SBRT) induced pulmonary fibrosis from local recurrence 
(LR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SBRT treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
suspected of LR by conventional imaging underwent MRI: T2 weighted, diffusion 
weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) with a 5-minute delayed 
sequence. MRI was reported as high or low suspicion of LR. Follow-up imaging 
≥12 months or biopsy defined LR status as proven LR, no-LR or not-verified.
RESULTS: MRI was performed between 10/2017 and 12/2021, at a median interval of 
22.5 (interquartile range 10.5-32.75) months after SBRT. Of the 20 lesions in 18 
patients: 4 had proven LR, 10 did not have LR and 6 were not verified for LR due 
to subsequent additional local and/or systemic therapy. MRI correctly identified 
as high suspicion LR in all proven LR lesions and low suspicion LR in all 
confirmed no-LR lesions. All proven LR lesions (4/4) showed heterogeneous 
enhancement and heterogeneous T2 signal, as compared to the proven no-LR lesions 
in which 7/10 had homogeneous enhancement and homogeneous T2 signal. DCE kinetic 
curves could not predict LR status. Although lower apparent diffusion 
coefficient (ADC) values were seen in proven LR lesions, no absolute cut-off ADC 
value could determine LR status.
CONCLUSION: In this pilot study of NSCLC patients after SBRT, multi-parametric 
chest MRI was able to correctly determine LR status, with no single parameter 
being diagnostic by itself. Further studies are warranted.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2023.107265

rapid proliferation and adaptation to harsh microenvironments. Yin Yang 2 (YY2) 
has recently been reported as a tumor suppressor downregulated in various types 
of tumors; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its tumor-suppressive 
activity remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the involvement of YY2 in tumor 
cell metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the 
novel regulatory mechanism of YY2 in the suppression of tumorigenesis. Using 
transcriptomic analysis, we uncovered an unprecedented link between YY2 and 
tumor cell serine metabolism. YY2 alteration could negatively regulate the 
expression level of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the first enzyme in 
the serine biosynthesis pathway, and consequently, tumor cell de novo serine 
biosynthesis. Mechanistically, we revealed that YY2 binds to the PHGDH promoter 
and suppresses its transcriptional activity. This, in turn, leads to decreased 
production of serine, nucleotides, and cellular reductants NADH and NADPH, which 
subsequently suppresses tumorigenic potential. These findings reveal a novel 
function of YY2 as a regulator of the serine metabolic pathway in tumor cells 
and provide new insights into its tumor suppressor activity. Furthermore, our 
findings suggest the potential of YY2 as a target for metabolic-based antitumor 
therapeutic strategies.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights

therapeutic tool for preventing human diseases. However, the number of 
well-verified plant ELNs remains limited. In this study, the microRNAs in ELNs 
derived from fresh Rehmanniae Radix, a well-known traditional Chinese herb for 
treating inflammatory and metabolic diseases, were determined by using microRNA 
sequencing to investigate the active components in the ELNs and the protection 
against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung inflammation in vivo and in 
vitro. The results showed that rgl-miR-7972 (miR-7972) was the main ingredient 
in ELNs. It exerted stronger protective activities against LPS-induced acute 
lung inflammation than catalpol and acteoside, which are two well-known chemical 
markers in this herb. Moreover, miR-7972 decreased the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells, thereby facilitating 
M2 macrophage polarization. Mechanically, miR-7972 downregulated the expression 
of G protein-coupled receptor 161 (GPR161), activating the Hedgehog pathway, and 
inhibited the biofilm form of Escherichia coli via targeting virulence gene 
sxt2. Therefore, miR-7972 derived from fresh R. Radix alleviated LPS-induced 
lung inflammation by targeting the GPR161-mediated Hedgehog pathway, recovering 
gut microbiota dysbiosis. It also provided a new direction for gaining novel

great success in the battle against malignant tumors, various commonly used 
photothermal sensitizers still suffer from non-selective tumor accumulation, 
limited photothermal conversion efficiency, potential toxicity and side effects, 
as well as complex and low cost-effective preparation process. Therefore, novel 
photothermal sensitizers are urgently required. The well-organized 
self-assembling of natural bacteriochlorophylls with superior photothermal 
property may provide an interesting option for the engineering of ideal PTS.
METHODS: Inspired by the self-assembly peripheral light-harvesting antennas of 
natural bacteriochlorin in microorganisms, a biomimetic light-harvesting 
nanosystem (Nano-Bc) was developed via bacteriochlorophylls self-arranging in 
aqueous phase. The characterization of Nano-Bc were measured using DLS, TEM, 
UV-vis-near-infrared spectroscopy and preclinical PA imaging system. The 
cytotoxicity of Nano-Bc was quantitatively evaluated via a standard MTT assay 
using mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells, and the in vivo photothermal eradication of 
tumor was investigated in the 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mouse model.
RESULTS: The obtained bacteriochlorin nanoparticles (Nano-Bc) exhibited 
ultra-high photothermal performance within the biological transparent window, 
showing superior heating capacity compared to commonly used photothermal 
sensitizers of organic dye indocyanine green and inorganic gold nanorods. 
Guiding by the inherent photoacoustic imaging of Nano-Bc, complete tumor 
elimination in vitro and vivo was evidenced upon laser irradiation.
CONCLUSION: The green and facile preparation, ultra-high photothermal effect in 
the transparent window, excellent photoacoustic imaging capacity, and great 
biosafety prompt, the bio-inspired Nano-Bc as a promising theranostic platform 
against cancer in the areas of healthcare.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights

poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in ovarian carcinoma. HRD scores 
have entered routine diagnostics, but the influence of algorithms, parameters 
and confounders has not been analyzed comprehensively. A series of 100 poorly 
differentiated ovarian carcinoma samples was analyzed using whole exome 
sequencing (WES) and genotyping. Tumor purity was determined using conventional 
pathology, digital pathology, and two bioinformatic methods. HRD scores were 
calculated from copy number profiles determined by Sequenza and by Sclust either 
with or without fixed tumor purity. Tumor purity determination by digital 
pathology combined with a tumory purity informed variant of Sequenza served as 
reference method for HRD scoring. Seven tumors had deleterious mutations in 
BRCA1/2, 12 tumors had deleterious mutations in other homologous recombination 
repair (HRR) genes, 18 tumors had variants of unknown significance (VUS) in 
BRCA1/2 or other HRR genes, while the remaining 63 tumors had no relevant 
alterations. Using the reference method for HRD scoring, 68 tumors were 
HRD-positive. HRDsum determined by WES correlated strongly with HRDsum 
determined by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays (R = 0.85). 
Conventional pathology systematically overestimated tumor purity by 8% compared 
to digital pathology. All investigated methods agreed on classifying the 
deleterious BRCA1/2-mutated tumors as HRD-positive, but discrepancies were 
observed for some of the remaining tumors. Discordant HRD classification of 11% 
of the tumors was observed comparing the tumor purity uninformed default of 
Sequenza and the reference method. In conclusion, tumor purity is a critical 
factor for the determination of HRD scores. Assistance by digital pathology 
helps to improve accuracy and imprecision of its estimation.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.tranon.2023.101706

cancer prevention and management. Biomarker discovery in specific cancers, 
especially at the pre-invasive stage, is vital for early diagnosis, positive 
treatment response, and good disease prognosis. Traditional diagnostic measures 
require invasive procedures such as tissue excision using a needle, an 
endoscope, and/or surgical resection which can be unsafe, expensive, and 
painful. Additionally, the presence of comorbid conditions in individuals might 
render them ineligible for undertaking a tissue biopsy, and in some cases, it is 
difficult to access tumours depending on the site of occurrence. In this 
context, liquid biopsies are being explored for their clinical significance in 
solid malignancies management. These non-invasive or minimally invasive methods 
are being developed primarily for identification of biomarkers for early 
diagnosis and targeted therapeutics. In this review, we have summarised the use 
and importance of liquid biopsy as significant tool in diagnosis, prognosis 
prediction, and therapeutic development. We have also discussed the challenges 
that are encountered and future perspective.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.tranon.2023.101716

can be significantly impaired following treatment. Exercise and dietary 
interventions could address this. The aim of this review was to determine 
whether exercise and/or dietary interventions which are scaffolded by behaviour 
change theories and techniques are associated with improved quality of life in 
middle-aged and older women following cancer treatment. Secondary outcomes 
included self-efficacy, distress, waist circumference, and food variety. A 
search of CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Embase, MEDLINE (EBSCOhost), PsycINFO, PubMed and 
Scopus databases up to 17th November 2022 was conducted. A narrative summary was 
provided. Twenty articles discussing 18 independent randomised controlled 
trials/interventions were included, with a total of 1754 participants. No 
studies reported the outcomes of distress or food variety. Exercise and/or 
dietary interventions had mixed effects on quality of life, self-efficacy and 
waist circumference (positive effect: n = 4/14; n = 3/5; n = 4/7, respectively). 
Two-thirds of the interventions (exercise-only, n = 2; exercise and diet, n = 2) 
that demonstrated an improvement in quality-of-life scores were based upon 
Social Cognitive Theory. All studies that reported improvements in waist 
circumference employed combined exercise and dietary interventions, with 
individualised aspects for the dietary components. Exercise and/or dietary 
interventions could potentially enhance quality of life and self-efficacy, and 
reduce waist circumference, in middle-aged and older women treated for cancer. 
Although findings are currently mixed, avenues for the development of 
interventions include ensuring there is a theoretical underpinning and 
incorporating more behaviour change techniques in exercise and/or dietary 
interventions in this population.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2023.05.007

delivery targeting nematodes in the rhizosphere. SNPs were obtained by thermal 
shape-switching of the TMGMV. We demonstrated that cargo can be loaded into the 
SNPs during thermal shape-switching, enabling the one-pot synthesis of

SNPs to achieve 10% mass loading. SNPs demonstrated good mobility and soil 
retention slightly higher than that of TMGMV rods. Ivermectin delivery to 
Caenorhabditis elegans using SNPs was determined after passing the formulations 
through soil. Using a gel burrowing assay, we demonstrate the potent efficacy of 
SNP-delivered ivermectin against nematodes. Like many pesticides, free 
ivermectin is adsorbed in the soil and did not show efficacy. The SNP 
nanotechnology offers good soil mobility and a platform technology for pesticide

patterns of care, responses to treatment, and outcomes not entirely clear. A 
particular feature includes more advanced stages at diagnosis. Our objective was 
to characterize these young patients with advanced disease and evaluate the 
impact of targeted therapies.
METHODS: Analyzing our cohort of 18,252 newly diagnosed NSCLC patients, we 
defined Young-age versus Norm-age based on the age distribution at the time of 
diagnosis. Stage-IV patients were investigated on their clinical information and 
outcomes; deaths were considered lung cancer-related. Primary outcome was 
overall survival (OS). Multivariate Cox models were built to evaluate 
independent prognostic factors in comparative age groups.
RESULTS: We found 4,267 patients with stage-IV NSCLC (359 Young-age; 3,908 
Norm-age). Young patients had predominance of females (52.6% vs. 43.3%, 
P = 0.001), never-smokers (43.2% vs. 14.8%, P < 0.001), and adenocarcinoma 
(73.5% vs. 62.5%, P < 0.001). Mean OS was 21.1 months in the Young and 15.1 
months in Norm, respectively (P < 0.001). Young patients were more often treated 
with surgery (6.7% vs. 5.0%), chemotherapy (53.2% vs. 44.1%), and targeted 
therapy (10.6% vs. 5.7%). Molecular studies were assessed in patients when the 
mutation tests became clinically available (93 Young, 875 Norm) and revealed a 
critical role of targeted therapy in the improved survival of both age groups.
DISCUSSION: Young patients with stage-IV NSCLC have a specific profile and 
benefit more when treated with surgery and targeted therapy. Molecular testing 
is critical in this population, where improved survival was identified. A more 
aggressive approach to this population needs to be considered.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ctarc.2023.100723

males. A growing prevalence has been documented in developed countries. Although 
recent advances have made TC an exceedingly treatable cancer, numerous zones in 
TC care still have divisive treatment decisions. In addition to physical 
examination and imaging techniques, conventional serum tumor markers have been 
traditionally used for the diagnosis of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). 
Unlike other genital and urinary tract tumors, recent research methods have not 
been broadly used in TGCTs. Even though several challenges in TC care must be 
addressed, a dedicated group of biomarkers could be particularly beneficial to 
help classify patient risk, detect relapse early, guide surgery decisions, and 
tailor follow-up. Existing tumor markers (Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic 
gonadotrophin, and lactate dehydrogenase) have limited accuracy and sensitivity 
when used as diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive markers. At present, 
microRNAs (miRNA or miR) play a crucial role in the process of several 
malignancies. The miRNAs exhibit pronounced potential as novel biomarkers since 
they reveal high stability in body fluids, are easily detected, and are 
relatively inexpensive in quantitative assays. In this review, we aimed to shed 
light on the recent novelties in developing microRNAs as diagnostic and 
prognostic markers in TC and discuss their clinical applications in TC 
management.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.prp.2023.154612

and pain are common symptoms reported by patients with breast cancer. Recent 
evidence suggests that palpitations, a feeling of the heart racing or pounding, 
may be equally common. Study purpose was to compare the severity and clinically 
meaningful occurrence rates of common symptoms and quality of life (QOL) 
outcomes between patients with breast cancer who did and did not report 
palpitations prior to surgery.
METHODS: Patients (n = 398) were classified as having or not having palpitations 
using a single item from the Menopausal Symptoms Scale. Valid and reliable 
measures were used to assess state and trait anxiety, depression, sleep 
disturbance, fatigue, energy, cognitive function, breast symptoms, and QOL. 
Between group differences were evaluated using parametric and non-parametric 
tests.
RESULTS: Patients with palpitations (15.1%) reported significantly higher 
severity scores for state and trait anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and 
fatigue as well as significant decrements in energy and cognitive function (all 
p < .05). A higher percentage of these patients had clinically meaningful levels

cancer, it is standard of care to perform pre- and post-NAC imaging to evaluate 
response to therapy prior to surgery. In this study we assess outcome metrics of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following NAC.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with invasive breast 
cancer who underwent a breast MRI before and after NAC between 2016 and 2021 at 
a single, multisite academic institution. All breast MRI studies were 
characterized as either radiologic complete response (rCR) or non-rCR. 
Corresponding surgical pathology reports were reviewed and categorized as 
pathologic complete response (pCR) or non-pCR. We defined a positive test as 
having residual enhancement on MRI (non-rCR) and a positive outcome as having 
residual disease on final surgical pathology (non-pCR).
RESULTS: There were 225 patients included in the study (mean age 52 ± 12 years). 
Breast cancer receptor distribution was HR+/HER2- (n = 71, 32%), HR+/HER2+ 
(n = 51, 23%), HR-/HER2- (n = 72, 32%), and HR-/HER2+ (n = 31, 14%). In total, 
78 (35%) had rCR and 77 (34%) had pCR; 43 (19%) had both rCR and pCR. The 
overall accuracy rate was 69% (156/225), sensitivity 76% (113/148), specificity 
56% (43/77), positive predictive value 77% (113/147), and negative predictive 
value 55% (43/78). The PPV was significantly associated with receptor status 
(p = 0.004). No patient or imaging characteristics were associated with 
sensitivity.
CONCLUSION: Breast MRI only moderately predicts pathologic response for invasive 
breast cancer treated with NAC (overall accuracy 69%). PPV is significantly 
associated with receptor status.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clinimag.2023.06.007

staging of endometrial carcinoma. The aims of the study were to explore the 
prevalence of self-reported lymphedema (LEL), identify factors associated with 
LEL, compare quality of life (QoL) scores using thresholds of clinical 
importance, and assess correlation between different questionnaires.
METHODS: Women who underwent staging for endometrial carcinoma from 2006 to 2021 
were invited to complete the Lower Extremity Lymphedema Screening Questionnaire 
(LELSQ), EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-EN24 and EQ-5D-5L.
RESULTS: Of 2156 invited survivors, 61% participated in the study, whereof 1127 
were evaluable by LELSQ. The LEL prevalence was 51%, 36% and 40% after 
lymphadenectomy, SLN and hysterectomy, respectively (p < 0.001). Higher BMI, 
undergoing lymphadenectomy and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were associated 
with LEL; odds ratios 1.07 (95% CI 1.05-1.09), 1.42 (95% CI 1.03-1.97) and 1.43 
(95% CI 1.08-1.89) respectively. QoL was lower for women with LEL compared to 
those without. In women with musculoskeletal complaints the prevalence of LEL 
was 59%, 50% and 53% after lymphadenectomy, SLN and hysterectomy (p = 0.115), 
respectively, compared to 39%, 17% and 18% (p < 0.001) in women without 
musculoskeletal complaints. Spearman's correlation was moderate to strong 
between the questionnaires.
CONCLUSION: SLN implementation is not associated with increased LEL prevalence 
compared to hysterectomy alone, but is associated with a significantly lower 
prevalence compared to lymphadenectomy. LEL is associated with lower QoL. Our 
study demonstrates moderate to strong correlation between self-reported LEL and 
QoL scores. Available questionnaires may not distinguish between symptoms caused 
by LEL and musculoskeletal disease.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.05.070

Trophoblastic Neoplasia (WHO 0-6) develop methotrexate-resistance (MTX-R). In 
the UK, subsequent treatment with either actinomycin-D (ActD) or multi-agent 
combination chemotherapy has depended on whether the hCG was above or below an 
hCG threshold. To reduce exposure to combination chemotherapy (CC), over the 
years the UK service has raised this threshold as well as using single-agent 
carboplatin AUC6 3-weekly at MTX-R instead of CC. Updated results for 
carboplatin demonstrate an 86% complete hCG response (hCG CR) but associated 
with haematological dose-limiting toxicity.
METHODS: In 2017, single-agent carboplatin became the national standard 
second-line treatment following MTX-R at hCG of >3000 IU/L. Carboplatin was 
changed to two-weekly AUC4 scheduling and continued until normal hCG plus 3 
consolidation cycles. For patients failing to respond, CC 
(Etoposide-Actinomycin-D or EMA-CO) was introduced.
RESULTS: 22 evaluable patients with a median hCG at MTX-R of 10,147 IU/L (IQR 
5527-19,639) received carboplatin AUC4 2-weekly (median no. of cycles = 6, IQR 
2-8). Of these, 36% achieved a hCG CR. All 14 non-CR patients were cured with 
subsequent CC; 11 and 2 patients with 3rd line and 4th line CC respectively and 
1 patient following 5th line CC and hysterectomy. Overall survival remains 100%.
CONCLUSION: Carboplatin is not sufficiently active in the second-line treatment 
of low-risk MTX-resistant GTN. New strategies are required to increase hCG CR 
and spare more toxic CC regimens.",Crown Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.05.072

low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC) and to quantify associations between 
NACT and extent of cytoreductive surgery.
METHODS: We identified women treated for stage III or IV serous ovarian cancer 
in a Commission on Cancer accredited program between January 2004-December 2020. 
Regression models were developed to evaluate trends in NACT use for LGSOC, to 
identify factors associated with receipt of NACT, and to quantify associations 
between NACT and bowel or urinary resection at the time of surgery. Demographic 
and clinical factors were used for confounder control.
RESULTS: We observed 3350 patients who received treatment for LGSOC during the 
study period. The proportion of patients who received NACT increased from 9.5% 
in 2004 to 25.9% in 2020, corresponding to an annual percent change of 7.2% (95% 
CI 5.6-8.9). Increasing age (rate ratio (RR) 1.15; 95% CI 1.07-1.24), and stage 
IV disease (RR 2.66; 95% CI 2.31-3.07) were associated with a higher likelihood 
of receiving NACT. For patients with high-grade disease, NACT was associated 
with a decrease in likelihood of bowel or urinary surgery (35.3% versus 23.9%; 
RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.71). For LGSOC, NACT was associated with a higher 
likelihood of these procedures (26.6% versus 32.2%; RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.42).
CONCLUSION: NACT use among patients with LGSOC has increased from 2004 to 2020. 
While NACT was associated with a lower rate of gastrointestinal and urinary 
surgery among patients with high-grade disease, patients with LGSOC receiving 
NACT were more likely to undergo these procedures.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.06.001

cervical cancer have affected compliance.
OBJECTIVE: We examined compliance with repeat cervical cancer screening among 
U.S. women aged 30-64 who underwent index screening between 2013 and 2019.
STUDY DESIGN: The IBM Watson Health MarketScan Database was used to identify 
commercially-insured women 30-64 years old who underwent cervical cancer 
screening from 2013 to 2019. The cohort was limited to women with continuous 
insurance 12 months before and ≥ 2 months after index testing. Patients with 
prior hysterectomy, more frequent surveillance needs, or a history of abnormal 
cytology, histology, or HPV test were excluded. Index screening included 
cytology, co-testing, or primary HPV testing. Cumulative incidence curves 
described screening intervals. Compliance was considered if repeat screening 
occurred 2.5-4 years after index cytology and 4.5-6 years after index 
co-testing. Cause-specific hazard models examined factors associated with 
compliance.
RESULTS: Of 5,368,713 patients identified, co-testing was performed in 2,873,070 
(53.5%), cytology in 2,422,480 (45.1%), and primary HPV testing in 73,163 
(1.4%). The cumulative incidence of repeat screening among all women by seven 
years was 81.9%. Of those who underwent repeat screening, 85.7% with index 
cytology and 96.6% with index co-testing were rescreened early. Only, 12.2% with 
index cytology had appropriate rescreening and 2.1% had delayed rescreening. 
Among the index co-testing group, 3.2% had appropriate rescreening and 0.3% had 
delayed rescreening.
CONCLUSION: Appropriate cervical cancer follow-up screening is highly variable. 
The cumulative incidence rate of repeat screening was 81.9% and among women 
rescreened, the vast majority are tested earlier than recommended by current 
guidelines.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.06.007

diagnosed venous thrombosis (VT), we found a high risk of arterial thrombotic 
events (AT) during treatment with therapeutic doses of apixaban.
METHODS: Total 298 cancer patients with VT received apixaban as treatment and 
secondary prophylaxis for up to 36 months. AT was registered as a serious 
adverse event, and this is a post hoc analysis of risk factors for AT. Clinical 
risk factors and concomitant medication were assessed through odds ratios (OR) 
with 95 % confidence interval using multivariate logistic regression. Biomarkers 
were assessed by non-parametric testing.
RESULTS: AT occurred in 16/298 patients (5.4 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 
3.1-8.6 %). Median leucocyte count at baseline was higher in patients with AT 
compared with patients without AT (11 vs. 6.8·109/L, p < 0.01). Clinical factors 
associated with AT were pancreatic cancer (OR 13.7, 95 % CI 4.3-43.1), ovarian 
cancer (OR 19.3, 95 % CI 2.3-164.4), BMI <25 percentile (OR 3.1, 95 % CI 
1.1-8.8) and previous VT (OR 4.4, 95 % CI 1.4-13.7). Pancreatic cancer had a 
cumulative incidence of AT of 36 % compared with 0.8 % for all other cancers at 
6 months (p < 0.01). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR 4.9, 95 % CI 
1.0-26) and antiplatelet treatment (OR 3.8, 95 % CI 1.2-12.2) were associated 
with AT.
CONCLUSION: In cancer patients with apixaban treated VT, pancreatic cancer was 
strongly associated with AT. In addition, ovarian cancer, BMI < 25 percentile, 
previous VT, antiplatelet treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use 
and high leucocyte count at baseline were associated with AT. The CAP study is

apoptosis and oxidative stress in lung epithelial cells. Ligustilide (LIG) is 
one of the main bioactive constituents derived from the Angelica sinensis. As a 
novel SIRT1 agonist, LIG owns powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidative 
properties, exerting remarkable therapeutic effects on cancers, neurological 
disorders, and diabetes mellitus. However, whether LIG could protect against 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI by activating SIRT1 remains unclear. Mice 
underwent intratracheal LPS injection to mimic sepsis-induced ALI while MLE-12 
cells were treated with LPS for 6 h to establish an in vitro ALI model. At the 
same time, mice or MLE-12 cells were treated with different doses of LIG to 
access its pharmacological effect. The results demonstrated that LIG 
pretreatment could improve LPS-induced pulmonary dysfunction and pathological 
injury, apart from increasing 7-day survival rate. In addition, LIG pretreatment 
also decreased inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis during LPS-induced 
ALI. Mechanically, LPS stimulation decreased the expression and activity of 
SIRT1 but increased the expression of Notch1 and NICD. And LIG could also 
enhance the interaction between SIRT1 and NICD, thus deacetylating NICD. In 
vitro experiments also unveiled that EX-527, a selective SIRT1 inhibitor, could 
abolish LIG-elicited protection in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells. And in SIRT1 
knockout mice with ALI, LIG pretreatment also lost its effects on inflammation, 
apoptosis, and oxidative stress during ALI.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.110486

(HER2) targeted strategies is limited due to impaired anti-tumor responses 
negatively regulated by immunosuppressive cells. We thus, investigated the 
inhibitory effects of an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (1 T0 mAb) in combination 
with CD11b+/Gr-1+ myeloid cells depletion in 4 T1-HER2 tumor model.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were challenged with human HER2-expressing 4 T1 murine 
breast cancer cell line. A week post tumor challenge, each mouse received 50 µg 
of a myeloid cells specific peptibody every other day, or 10 mg/kg of 1 T0 mAb 
two times a week, and their combination for two weeks. The treatments effect on 
tumor growth was measured by calculating tumor size. Also, the frequencies of 
CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells and T lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Peptibody treated mice indicated tumor regression and 40 % of the mice 
eradicated their primary tumors. The peptibody was capable to deplete notably 
splenic CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells as well as intratumoral CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells 
(P < 0.0001) and led to an increased number of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells 
(3.3 folds) and also that of resident tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) (3 
folds). Combination of peptibody and 1 T0 mAb resulted in enhanced expansion of 
tumor infiltrating CD4 + and CD8+ T cells which was associated with tumor 
eradication in 60 % of the mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Peptibody is able to deplete CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells and increase 
anti-tumoral effects of the 1 T0 mAb in tumor eradication. Thus, this myeloid 
population have critical roles in development of tumors and their depletion is 
associated with induction of anti-tumoral responses.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.110463

gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are neoplastic lesions of the small bowel 
while small bowel adenomas are precursors of SBA.
AIM: To examine mortality in patients diagnosed with SBA, small bowel adenomas, 
NET and GIST.
METHODS: We performed a population-based matched cohort study encompassing all 
individuals with SBA (n = 2289), adenomas (n = 3700), NET (n = 1884) and GIST 
(n = 509) in the small bowel diagnosed at any of Sweden's 28 pathology 
departments between 2000 and 2016 (the ""ESPRESSO study""). Each case was matched 
by sex, age, calendar year and county of residence to up to 5 comparators from 
the general population. Through Cox regression we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for death and cause-specific death 
adjusting for education.
RESULTS: During follow-up until December 31, 2017, 1836 (80%) deaths occurred in 
SBA patients, 1615 (44%) in adenoma, 866 (46%) in NET and 162 (32%) in GIST 
patients. This corresponded to incidence rates of 295, 74, 80 and 62/1000 
person-years respectively and adjusted HRs of 7.60 (95%CI=6.95-8.31), 2.21 
(2.07-2.36), 2.74 (2.50-3.01) and 2.33 (1.90-2.87). Adjustment for education had 
a substantial impact on the HR for death in SBA but not for other neoplasias. 
The predominant cause of excess death was cancer in all groups.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms earlier findings of increased death rates in 
patients with SBA and NET in a modern study population. We also demonstrate a 
more than 2-fold increased risk of death in both GIST and the SBA precursor 
adenoma.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.canep.2023.102399

laryngeal cancer in two decades and its epidemiological, clinical, and 
histological characteristics by sex in Brazil.
METHODS: This ecological study used three reliable sources of secondary data: 
population- and hospital-based cancer registries and the national mortality 
database. All data available from 2000 to 2019 were considered.
RESULTS: The incidence of male laryngeal cancer decreased from 9.20 to 4.95 per 
100,000 from 2000 to 2018, while mortality slightly decreased from 3.37 to 3.30 
per 100,000 from 2000 to 2019. In the same period, the female incidence 
decreased from 1.26 to 0.48 per 100,000; however, mortality slightly increased 
from 0.34 to 0.36 per 100,000. Of 221,566 individuals with head and neck cancer, 
27 % presented laryngeal cancer. The median age was 61 years (54-69), and most 
individuals were male (86.6 %), smokers (66.2 %), diagnosed with locally 
advanced cancer (66.7 %), and squamous cell carcinoma as the main histological 
type (93.2 %). Male tended to be older (p < 0.001), white (p < 0.001), smokers 
(p < 0.001), and present late treatment initiation (p < 0.001) and early death 
(p < 0.001) compared with female.
CONCLUSION: The male laryngeal cancer affected mainly at productive age but with 
a decreased incidence, probably due to a reduction in smoking habit. However, 
mortality did not change, which may be explained by the late diagnosis and lack 
of access to radiotherapy.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.canep.2023.102397

disorder (BD), we conducted a Mendelian Randomization (MR) design to screen 
circulating proteins for the potential risk of bipolar disorder systematically.
METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to 
estimate the causality of 4782 human circulating proteins on the risk of bipolar 
disorder. 376 circulating biomarkers were selected in MR estimation (4406 
circulating proteins with less than 3 SNPs were excluded) with 5368 European 
descents. GWAS meta-analysis of the potential role of all-cause bipolar disorder 
arose from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (41,917 cases, 371,549 controls).
RESULTS: After IVW and sensitivity analysis, 4 circulating proteins having 
causal effects on bipolar disorder were identified. ISG15, as a key player in 
the innate immune response, decreased the risk of bipolar disorder causally 
(OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.89-0.94, P = 1.46e-09). Furthermore, MLN decreased the 
risk of bipolar disorder causally (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91-0.97, P = 1.04e-04). 
In addition, SFTPC (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.86-0.96, P = 4.47e-04) and VCY 
(OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77-0.96, P = 8.55e-03) presented a suggestive association 
with bipolar disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that ISG15 and MLN showed evidence of 
causality in bipolar disorder and provided a promising target for the diagnosis 
and treatment of diseases.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.05.070

lifestyle behaviors that may lead them to better health. This quest for improved 
health can be exaggerated in unhealthy ways if it is not approached with 
moderation as occurs with a condition called orthorexia nervosa (ON). Our aim in 
this study was to determine the prevalence of ON tendencies and their behavioral 
correlates among Lebanese adults with cancer. This was a monocentric 
cross-sectional study, conducted between December 2021 and February 2022, 
involving 366 patients. We collected data via telephone and recorded answers 
online on a Google form. We used the Düsseldorf Orthorexia Scale (DOS) to assess 
orthorexic behaviors, and we checked for behavioral correlates of orthorexia 
through a linear regression model using the DOS score as the dependent variable. 
On the DOS scale, we found that 9% of these participants showed possible ON 
tendencies, whereas 22.2% had definite ON tendencies. Factors associated with 
having more ON tendencies were (a) receipt of hormonotherapy, (b) being female 
and (c) having breast cancer. Having prostate cancer was significantly 
associated with fewer ON tendencies. Our results should help improve the 
management of patients with cancer through programs to increase patient 
awareness and education.","DOI: 10.1177/00315125231182733

adagrasib in patients with KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC and untreated CNS metastases 
from the KRYSTAL-1 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03785249; phase Ib 
cohort), in which adagrasib 600 mg was administered orally, twice daily. Study 
outcomes included the safety and clinical activity (intracranial [IC] and 
systemic) by blinded independent central review. Twenty-five patients with 
KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC and untreated CNS metastases were enrolled and evaluated 
(median follow-up, 13.7 months); 19 patients were radiographically evaluable for 
IC activity. Safety was consistent with previous reports of adagrasib, with 
grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in 10 patients (40%) and one 
grade 4 (4%) and no grade 5 TRAEs. The most common CNS-specific TRAEs included 
dysgeusia (24%) and dizziness (20%). Adagrasib demonstrated an IC objective 
response rate of 42%, disease control rate of 90%, progression-free survival of 
5.4 months, and median overall survival of 11.4 months. Adagrasib is the first 
KRASG12C inhibitor to prospectively demonstrate IC activity in patients with

concern for years, there is increasing recognition that some older women are 
overtreated, receiving therapies unlikely to improve survival or reduce 
morbidity. De-escalation of surgery may include breast-conserving surgery over 
mastectomy for appropriate candidates and omitting or reducing extent of 
axillary surgery. Appropriate patients to de-escalate surgery are those with 
early-stage breast cancer, favorable tumor characteristics, are clinically 
node-negative, and who may have other major health issues. De-escalation of 
radiation includes reducing treatment course length through hypofractionation 
and ultrahypofractionation regimens, reducing treatment volumes through partial 
breast irradiation, omission of radiation for select patients, and reducing 
radiation dose to normal tissues. Shared decision making, which aims to

preferred treatment strategy for patients with stage 1 testicular cancer after 
orchidectomy although a personalized discussion is required.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an analysis of individuals registered in 
iTestis, Australia's testicular cancer registry, to describe the patterns of 
relapse and outcomes of patients treated in Australia where the Australian and 
New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group Surveillance 
Recommendations are widely adopted.
RESULTS: A total of 650 individuals diagnosed between 2000 and 2020 were 
included, 63% (411 of 650) seminoma and 37% (239 of 650) nonseminoma. The median 
age was 34 years (range 14-74). 26% (106 of 411) with seminoma and 15% (36 of 
239) nonseminoma received adjuvant chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 43 
months (range 0-267) postorchidectomy, relapse occurred in 10% (43 of 411) of 
seminoma and 18% (43 of 239) of nonseminoma. The two-year relapse-free survival 
was 92% (95% CI, 89 to 95) and 82% (95% CI, 78 to 87) in seminoma and 
nonseminoma, respectively. All relapses (86 of 86) were detected at a routine 
surveillance visit; 98% (85 of 86) were asymptomatic and detected solely through 
imaging (62 of 86, 72%), tumor markers (6 of 86, 7%), or a combination (17 of 
86, 20%). The most common relapse site was isolated retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy (53 of 86, 62%). No nonpulmonary visceral metastases occurred. 
At relapse, 98% (84 of 86) had International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative 
Group (IGCCCG) good prognosis; 2 of 86 intermediate prognosis (both 
nonseminoma). No deaths occurred.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort of stage 1 testicular cancer, where national 
surveillance recommendations have been widely adopted, recurrences were detected 
at routine surveillance visits and, almost exclusively, asymptomatic with IGCCCG 
good-prognosis disease. This provides reassurance that active surveillance is 
safe.","DOI: 10.1200/OP.23.00191

professional and personal well-being, the optimal delivery of quality cancer 
care, and the future cancer care workforce, with many departing the field. 
Hence, the identification of evidence-based approaches to sustain oncologists is 
essential to promote well-being.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a brief, oncologist-centered, virtual group 
peer support program and tested its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
impact on well-being. Trained facilitators provided support to peers on the 
basis of burnout research in oncology with available resources to enhance 
oncologist resilience. Peers completed pre- and postsurvey assessment of 
well-being and satisfaction.
RESULTS: From April to May 2022, 11 of 15 (73%) oncologists participated in its 
entirety: mean age 51.1 years (range, 33-70), 55% female, 81.8% Ca, 82% medical 
oncologists, 63.6% trained ≥15 years, average 30.3 patients/wk (range, 5-60), 
and 90.9% employed in hospital/health system practice. There was a statistically 
significant difference in pre- and postintervention well-being (7.0 ± 3.6 v 8.2 
± 3.0, P = .03) with high satisfaction with postgroup experience (9.1 ± 2.5). 
These quantitative improvements were affirmed by qualitative feedback. These 
themes included (1) an enhanced understanding of burnout in oncology, (2) shared 
experience in practice of oncology, and (3) fostering connections with diverse 
colleagues. Future recommendations proposed included (1) restructuring group 
format and (2) tailoring groups according to practice setting (academic v 
community).
CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest that a brief, innovative 
oncologist-tailored group peer support program is feasible, acceptable, and 
beneficial for enhancing well-being dimensions including burnout, engagement, 
and satisfaction. Additional study is required to refine program components 
(optimal timing, format) to support oncologist well-being, now during the 
pandemic and well into recovery.","DOI: 10.1200/OP.23.00068

the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of datopotamab deruxtecan 
(Dato-DXd), a novel trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed 
antibody-drug conjugate in solid tumors, including advanced non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC received 
0.27-10 mg/kg Dato-DXd once every 3 weeks during escalation or 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg 
Dato-DXd once every 3 weeks during expansion. Primary end points were safety and 
tolerability. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), 
survival, and pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: Two hundred ten patients received Dato-DXd, including 180 in the 4-8 
mg/kg dose-expansion cohorts. This population had a median of three prior lines 
of therapy. The maximum tolerated dose was 8 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; the 
recommended dose for further development was 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. In 
patients receiving 6 mg/kg (n = 50), median duration on study, including 
follow-up, and median exposure were 13.3 and 3.5 months, respectively. The most 
frequent any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nausea (64%), 
stomatitis (60%), and alopecia (42%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs and treatment-related AEs 
occurred in 54% and 26% of patients, respectively. Interstitial lung disease 
adjudicated as drug-related (two grade 2 and one grade 4) occurred in three of 
50 patients (6%). The ORR was 26% (95% CI, 14.6 to 40.3), and median duration of 
response was 10.5 months; median progression-free survival and overall survival 
were 6.9 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 8.8 months) and 11.4 months (95% CI, 7.1 to 20.6 
months), respectively. Responses occurred regardless of TROP2 expression.
CONCLUSION: Promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile were 
seen with Dato-DXd in heavily pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC. Further 
investigation as first-line combination therapy in advanced NSCLC and as 
monotherapy in the second-line setting and beyond is ongoing.","DOI: 10.1200/JCO.23.00059

penetration process. The obtained results confirm that GO is a suitable surface 
for hosting the prodrug and passing it through the membrane. Furthermore, the 
investigation of the release process shows that the PD can be released under 
acidic conditions. This phenomenon is due to the reduction of the contribution 
of electrostatic energy in the GO and PD interaction and the entry of water into 
the drug delivery system. Moreover, it is found that an external electrical 
field does not have much effect on drug release. Our results provide a deep 
understanding of the prodrug delivery systems, which helps the combination of 
nanocarriers and modified chemotherapy drugs in the future.","DOI: 10.1021/acsabm.3c00276

cells, thereby potentially inducing in situ vaccination (ISV) to prime systemic 
antitumor immune responses. However, RT alone is often faced with various 
limitations during ISV induction, such as insufficient X-ray deposition and an 
immunosuppressive microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, we 
constructed nanoscale coordination particles AmGd-NPs by self-assembling high-Z 
metal gadolinium (Gd) and small molecular CD73 inhibitor AmPCP. Then, AmGd-NPs 
could synergize with RT to enhance immunogenic cell death, improve phagocytosis, 
and promote antigen presentation. Additionally, AmGd-NPs could also gradually 
release AmPCP to inhibit CD73's enzymatic activity and prevent the conversion of 
extracellular ATP to adenosine (Ado), thereby driving a proinflammatory tumor 
microenvironment that promotes DC maturation. As a result, AmGd-NPs sensitized 
RT induced potent in situ vaccination and boosted CD8+ T cell-dependent 
antitumor immune responses against both primary and metastatic tumors, which 
could also be potentiated by immune checkpoint inhibitory therapy.","DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.2c11403

effective cancer treatment. The emerging understanding of the importance of 
metastasis in hematological malignancies suggests that it could also play a role 
in drug resistance and relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In a cohort of 
1,273 AML patients, we uncovered that the multifunctional scavenger receptor 
CD36 was positively associated with extramedullary dissemination of leukemic 
blasts, increased risk of relapse after intensive chemotherapy, and reduced 
event-free and overall survival. CD36 was dispensable for lipid uptake but 
fostered blast migration through its binding with thrombospondin-1. 
CD36-expressing blasts, which were largely enriched after chemotherapy, 
exhibited a senescent-like phenotype while maintaining their migratory ability. 
In xenograft mouse models, CD36 inhibition reduced metastasis of blasts and 
prolonged survival of chemotherapy-treated mice. These results pave the way for 
the development of CD36 as an independent marker of poor prognosis in AML 
patients and a promising actionable target to improve the outcome of patients.","DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-3682

therapeutic modalities, important concerns exist about the potential toxicity of 
the approach owing to uncontrolled degradation of proteins and undesirable 
ligase-mediated off-target effects. Precision manipulation of degradation 
activity of PROTACs could minimize potential toxicity and side effects. As a 
result, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing cancer biomarker 
activating prodrugs of PROTACs. In this investigation, we developed a 
bioorthogonal on-demand prodrug strategy (termed click-release ""crPROTACs"") that 
enables on-target activation of PROTAC prodrugs and release of PROTACs in cancer 
cells selectively. Inactive PROTAC prodrugs TCO-ARV-771 and TCO-DT2216 are 
rationally designed by conjugating a bioorthogonal trans-cyclooctenes (TCO) 
group into the ligand of the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase. The tetrazine 
(Tz)-modified RGD peptide, c(RGDyK)-Tz, which targets integrin αvβ3 biomarker in 
cancer cells, serves as the activation component for click-release of the PROTAC 
prodrugs to achieve targeted degradation of proteins of interest (POIs) in 
cancer cells versus noncancerous normal cells. The results of studies accessing 
the viability of this strategy show that the PROTAC prodrugs are selectively 
activated in an integrin αvβ3-dependent manner to produce PROTACs, which degrade 
POIs in cancer cells. The crPROTAC strategy might be a general, abiotic approach 
to induce selective cancer cell death through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.","DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c05159

specific targets with high affinity. Currently, DNA aptamers can be produced 
only by in vitro synthesis. It is difficult for DNA aptamers to have a sustained 
impact on intracellular protein activity, which limits their clinical 
application. In this study, we developed a DNA aptamer expression system to 
generate DNA aptamers with functional activity in mammalian cells by mimicking 
retroviruses. Using this system, DNA aptamers targeting intracellular Ras (Ra1) 
and membrane-bound CD71 (XQ2) were successfully generated in cells. In 
particular, the expressed Ra1 not only specifically bound to the intracellular 
Ras protein but also inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream ERK1/2 and AKT. 
Furthermore, by inserting the DNA aptamer expression system for Ra1 into a 
lentivirus vector, the system can be delivered into cells and stably produce Ra1 
over time, resulting in the inhibition of lung cancer cell proliferation. 
Therefore, our study provides a novel strategy for the intracellular generation 
of DNA aptamers with functional activity and opens a new avenue for the clinical 
application of intracellular DNA aptamers in disease treatment.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00387

in the United States bear a greater burden of cervical cancer morbidity and 
mortality and may face unique barriers that preclude screening adherence. 
Methods: Participants were 710 My Body My Test-3 clinical trial participants who 
were publicly insured or uninsured with incomes ≤250% of the U.S. Federal 
Poverty Level, aged 25-64 years, and not up to date on cervical cancer screening 
as per national guidelines. Using Health Belief Model constructs, we assessed 
screening-related knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors-overall and stratified 
by race and ethnicity-and estimated associations with past-year attempted 
screening using multivariable regression models. Results: Overall, knowledge was 
low about the human papillomavirus, purpose of a Pap test, and recommended 
screening interval. Perceived severity of cervical cancer was high (3.63 on a 
4-point scale). Black and Latina/Hispanic women were more likely to perceive 
screening as lowering their risk of cervical cancer than White women. Black 
women reported lower perceived risk of cervical cancer compared with White women 
(p = 0.03), but Black women were more likely to have sought screening in the 
past year (p = 0.01). Having at least three doctor visits in the past year was 
associated with a screening attempt. Greater perceived risk of cervical cancer, 
more positive perceptions of screening, and feeling more nervousness about 
screening were also associated with a screening attempt (all p < 0.05). 
Conclusions: Addressing knowledge gaps and misconceptions about cervical cancer 
screening and leveraging positive perceptions of screening may improve screening 
uptake and adherence among diverse underscreened U.S. women. Clinical Trial

colorectal cancer screening programs around the world and increasingly for 
triage of symptomatic patients. FIT results are currently not traceable to a 
common reference standard and results obtained on various FIT systems may not be 
equivalent. The size of the bias between the systems is difficult to quantify 
due to the complex pre-analytical aspects of FIT.
METHODS: This study aimed to quantify the bias and the correlation between four 
FIT systems by measuring a panel of 38 faecal samples while limiting the effect 
of the pre-analytical aspects. In addition, the commutability of seven candidate 
reference materials (RM) was assessed.
RESULTS: Pairwise method comparisons based on faecal samples demonstrated 
Pearson correlation coefficients ranging between 0.944 and 0.970 and an average 
proportional bias of -30 to -35 % for one FIT system compared to the other 
three. The relative standard deviation among biases of the individual samples 
was around 20 %. Due to these sample specific differences, no decisive 
conclusions could be drawn in the commutability study. However, two candidate 
RMs, prepared in the FIT system-specific storage/extraction buffers, had a 
better commutable profile than the other five.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a common threshold for all FIT systems is currently not 
possible due to the presence of a proportional bias. We have identified 
potential commutable RMs to take to further studies on the production of a 
common calibrator, with the aim being to reduce the analytical bias observed on 
different FIT systems.","© 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","DOI: 10.1515/cclm-2023-0278

ensured through total quality management systems (TQM), which primarily include 
internal quality control (IQC) practices. However, quality practices vary 
globally. To understand the current global state of IQC practice and IQC 
management in relation to TQM the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry 
and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on Global Laboratory Quality (TF-GLQ) 
conducted a survey of IFCC member countries on IQC practices and management.
METHODS: The survey included 16 questions regarding IQC and laboratory TQM 
practices and was distributed to IFCC full and affiliate member countries 
(n=110). A total of 46 (41.8 %) responses were received from all regions except 
North America.
RESULTS: Of the responding countries, 78.3 % (n=36) had legislative regulations 
or accreditation requirements governing medical laboratory quality standards. 
However, implementation was not mandatory in 46.7 % (n=21) of responding 
countries. IQC practices varied considerably with 57.1 % (n=28) of respondents 
indicating that they run 2 levels of IQC, 66.7 % (n=24) indicating they run IQC 
every 24 h and 66.7 % (n=28) using assay manufacturer IQC material sources. Only 
29.3 % (n=12) of respondents indicated that every medical laboratory in their 
country has written IQC policies and procedures. By contrast, 97.6 % (n=40) of 
responding countries indicated they take corrective action and result 
remediation in the event of IQC failure.

if preoperative pain mechanisms, anxiety, and depression increase risk of 
developing chronic post-thoracotomy pain (CPTP) after lung cancer surgery.
METHODS: Patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer undergoing surgery by 
either video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or anterior thoracotomy were 
recruited consecutively. Preoperative assessments were conducted by: 
quantitative sensory testing (QST) (brush, pinprick, cuff pressure pain 
detection threshold, cuff pressure tolerance pain threshold, temporal summation 
and conditioned pain modulation), neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI), and 
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Clinical parameters in 
relation to surgery were also collected. Presence of CPTP was determined after 
six months and defined as pain of any intensity in relation to the operation 
area on a numeric rating scale form 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).
RESULTS: A total of 121 patients (60.2 %) completed follow-up and 56 patients 
(46.3 %) reported CPTP. Development of CPTP was associated with higher 
preoperative HADS score (p=0.025), higher preoperative NPSI score (p=0.009) and 
acute postoperative pain (p=0.042). No differences were observed in relation to 
preoperative QST assessment by cuff algometry and HADS anxiety and depression 
sub-scores.
CONCLUSIONS: High preoperative HADS score preoperative pain, acute postoperative 
pain intensity, and preoperative neuropathic symptoms were was associated with 
CPTP after lung cancer surgery. No differences in values of preoperative QST 
assessments were found. Preoperative assessment and identification of patients 
at higher risk of postoperative pain will offer opportunity for further 
exploration and development of preventive measures and individualised pain 
management depending on patient risk profile.","© 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","DOI: 10.1515/sjpain-2023-0016

N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modification in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy 
controls were collected. The expression of m6A-modification related proteins and 
m6A levels were detected using PCR, western blot and m6A ELISA. The roles of 
methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) in the regulation of inflammation in RA was 
explored using MeRIP-sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Collagen 
antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) mice were used as an in vivo model to study 
the role of METTL14 in the inflammation progression of RA.
RESULTS: We found that m6A writer METTL14 and m6A levels were decreased in PBMCs 
of active RA patients, and correlated negatively with the disease activity score 
using 28 joint counts (DAS28). Knockdown of METTL14 down-regulated m6A, and 
promoted the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17 in PBMCs of RA 
patients. Consistently, METTL14 knockdown promoted joint inflammation 
accompanied by upregulation of IL-6 and IL-17 in CAIA mice. MeRIP-sequencing and 
functional studies confirmed that tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3 
(TNFAIP3), a key suppressor of NF-κB inflammatory pathway, was involved in 
m6A-regulated PBMCs. Mechanistic investigations revealed that m6A affected 
TNFAIP3 expression by regulation of mRNA stability and translocation in TNFAIP3 
protein-coding regions (CDS).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the critical roles of m6A on regulation of 
inflammation in RA progression. Treatment strategies targeting m6A modification 
may represent a new option for management of RA. This article is protected by

of naïve CBγδ into cells expressing neoantigen-reactive tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocyte as well as tissue-resident memory precursor-like and 
antigen-presenting cell-like gene signatures. TCRγδ clonal tracing revealed a 
bias toward cytotoxic effector differentiation in a much larger proportion of 
Vδ2- clones compared to Vδ2+ clones, resulting in the former being more 
cytotoxic at the population level. These clonotype-specific differentiation 
dynamics were not restricted to REP and were recapitulated upon secondary 
nonviral antigen stimulations. Thus, our data showed intrinsic cellular 
differences between major subtypes of human γδ T cells already in operation at 
early postnatal stage and highlighted key areas of consideration in optimizing 
cell manufacturing processes.","DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adf3120

mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in high grade serous ovarian 
cancer (HGSOC). Patients and Methods We used targeted sequencing (TS) to analyse 
78 longitudinal cfDNA samples collected from 30 patients with HGSOC enrolled in 
a phase II clinical trial evaluating cediranib (VEGF inhibitor) plus olaparib 
(PARPi) after progression on PARPi alone. cfDNA was collected at baseline, 
before treatment cycle 2, and at end of treatment. These were compared to whole 
exome sequencing (WES) of baseline tumour tissues. Results At baseline (time of 
initial PARPi progression), cfDNA tumour fractions were 0.2-67% (median 3.25%) 
and patients with high ctDNA levels (>15%) had a higher tumour burden (sum of 
target lesions; p = 0.043). Across all timepoints, cfDNA detected known from 
tumour WES with 74.4% sensitivity, and detected 3 of 5 expected BRCA1/2 
reversion mutations. In addition, cfDNA identified 10 novel mutations not 
detected by WES, including 7 TP53 mutations annotated as pathogenic by ClinVar. 
cfDNA fragmentation analysis attributed 5 of these novel TP53 mutations to 
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). At baseline, samples 
with significant differences in mutant fragment size distribution had shorter 
time to progression (p = 0.001). Conclusions Longitudinal testing of cfDNA by TS 
provides a non-invasive tool for detection of tumour-derived mutations and 
mechanisms of PARPi resistance that may aid in directing patients to appropriate 
therapeutic strategies. With cfDNA fragmentation analyses, CHIP was identified 
in several patients and warrants further investigation.","DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0797

anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties - in newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma (GBM) patients who also received radiation and temozolomide. 
Perfusion MRI and myeloid-related gene transcription and inflammatory 
infiltrates in pre-and post-treatment tumor specimens were studied to evaluate 
on-target effects (NCT03139916).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three adults with 
isocitrate-dehydrogenase-wild-type GBM received 6 weeks of concurrent 
chemoradiation, followed by 6 cycles of temozolomide (C1-C6). Bavituximab was 
given weekly, starting week 1 of chemoradiation, for at least 18 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was proportion of patients alive at 12 months (OS-12). The null 
hypothesis would be rejected if OS-12 was ≥72%. Relative cerebral blood flow 
(rCBF) and vascular permeability (Ktrans) were calculated from perfusion MRIs. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor tissue were analyzed 
pre-treatment and at disease progression using RNA transcriptomics and 
multispectral immunofluorescence for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) 
and macrophages.
RESULTS: The study met its primary endpoint with an OS-12 of 73% (95% CI 
59-90%). Decreased pre-C1 rCBF (HR 4.63, p=0.029) and increased pre-C1 Ktrans 
were associated with improved OS (HR 0.09, p=0.005). Pre-treatment, 
overexpression of myeloid-related genes in tumor tissue was associated with 
longer survival. Post-treatment, tumor specimens contained fewer 
immunosuppressive MDSCs (p=0.01).
DISCUSSION: Bavituximab has activity in newly diagnosed GBM and resulted in 
on-target depletion of intratumoral immunosuppressive MDSCs. Elevated 
pre-treatment expression of myeloid-related transcripts in GBM may predict 
response to bavituximab.","DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0203

minimally-invasive treatment option for intracranial tumors. Our group produced 
plasmonics-active gold nanostars (GNS) designed to preferentially accumulate 
within intracranial tumors and amplify the ablative capacity of LITT.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The impact of GNS on LITT coverage capacity was tested in 
ex vivo models utilizing clinical LITT equipment and agarose gel-based phantoms 
of control and GNS-infused central ""tumors"". In vivo accumulation of GNS and 
amplification of ablation were tested in murine intracranial and extracranial 
tumor models followed by IV GNS injection, PET/CT, two-photon photoluminescence, 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), histopathology, and laser 
ablation.
RESULTS: Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated the potential of GNS to accelerate 
and specify thermal distributions. In ex vivo cuboid tumor phantoms, the 
GNS-infused phantom heated 5.5x faster than the control. In a split-cylinder 
tumor phantom, the GNS-infused border heated 2x faster and the surrounding area 
was exposed to 30% lower temperatures, with margin conformation observed in a 
model of irregular GNS distribution. In vivo, GNS preferentially accumulated 
within intracranial tumors on PET/CT, two-photon photoluminescence, and ICP-MS 
at 24 and 72 hours and significantly expedited and increased the maximal 
temperature achieved in laser ablation compared to control.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence for use of GNS to improve the 
efficiency and potentially safety of LITT. The in vivo data support selective 
accumulation within intracranial tumors and amplification of laser ablation, and 
the GNS-infused phantom experiments demonstrate increased rates of heating, heat 
contouring to tumor borders, and decreased heating of surrounding regions 
representing normal structures.","DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-1871

system and inflammatory responses and may serve as prognostic biomarkers for 
HPV-associated OPSCC.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study included 1013 patients with incident OPSCC, of 
whom 489 had tumor HPV16 status determined. All patients were genotyped for two 
functional polymorphisms: TGF-β1 rs1800470 and TGF-βR1 rs334348. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression models were performed to evaluate associations 
between the polymorphisms and OS, DSS, and DFS.
RESULTS: Patients with TGF-β1rs1800470 CT or CC genotype had significantly 
70%-80% reduced risks of OS, DSS, and DFS compared with patients with TT 
genotype, and patients with TGF-βR1rs334348 GA or GG genotype had significantly 
30%-40% reduced risks of OS, DSS, and DFS compared with patients with AA 
genotype. Furthermore, among patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, the same patterns 
were observed but the risk reductions were greater: up to 80%-90% for 
TGF-β1rs1800470 CT or CC genotype and 70%-85% for TGF-βR1rs334348 GA or GG 
genotype. The risk reductions were greater still, up to 17-25 times reduced, for 
patients with both TGF-β1rs1800470 CT or CC genotype and TGF-βR1rs334348 GA or 
GG genotype compared to patients with both TGF-β1rs1800470 TT genotype and

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that TGF-β1rs1800470 and TGF-βR1rs334348 may 
individually or jointly modify risks of death and recurrence in patients with 
OPSCC, particularly those with HPV-positive OPSCC patients undergoing definitive

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we combined spatial and single-cell transcriptomics 
to deconvolute the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment in regard 
with response to immunotherapy, in a cohort of both naive and resistant BCCs.
RESULTS: We identified subsets of intermingled cancer-associated fibroblasts 
(CAFs) and macrophages contributing the most to CD8 T cells exclusion and 
immunosuppression. Within this spatially-resolved peritumoral immunosuppressive 
niche, CAFs and adjacent macrophages were found to display Activin A-mediated 
transcriptional reprogramming towards extracellular matrix remodeling, 
suggesting active participation to CD8 T cells exclusion. In independent 
datasets of human skin cancers, Activin A-conditioned CAFs and macrophages were 
associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).

become radioactive iodide refractory (RAIR), which lack a molecular marker and 
have fewer treatment selections. A higher uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
(18F-FDG) might indicate poor prognosis for DTC. This study aimed to evaluate 
the clinical value of 18F-FDG psitron emission tomography/computed tomography 
(PET/CT) for the early diagnosis of RAIR-DTC and high-risk DTC. A total of 68 
DTC patients were enrolled and underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of 
recurrence and/or metastasis. 18F-FDG uptake was evaluated in patients with 
different postoperative recurrence risks or TNM stages and compared between RAIR 
and non-RAIR-DTC based on its maximum standardized uptake value and tumor/liver 
(T/L) ratio. The final diagnosis was judged by histopathology and follow-up 
data. Of 68 DTC cases, 42 were RAIR and 24 non-RAIR, with 2 not determined. A 
total of 263 of 293 lesions detected on 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed to be 
locoregional or metastatic after follow-up. The T/L ratio was significantly 
higher for RAIR than for non-RAIR (median 5.18 vs 1.44; P < .01) and also 
significantly higher in postoperative patients at high-risk of recurrence than 
at low to medium risk (median 4.90 vs 2.16; P < .01). 18F-FDG PET/CT exhibited a 
sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 87.5% for identifying RAIR, with a 
cutoff T/L value of 2.98. 18F-FDG PET/CT has the potential to diagnose RAIR-DTC 
early and identify the high-risk DTC. The T/L ratio is a useful parameter for 
the detection of RAIR-DTC patients.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000033878

progress or metastasis.
INTRODUCTION: TLC is a rare malignant cutaneous adnexal tumor. It usually occurs 
on sun-exposed areas in elderly people but rarely occurs in the periorbital 
region. Most cases accept surgery or micrographic Mohs surgery. Recurrence or 
metastasis of this neoplasm was seldom reported in the medical literature after 
enough tumor-free margin surgery. And radiotherapy was seldom reported in the 
treatment for patients of TLC.

periorbital region after surgery who was subsequently treated with radiotherapy 
with a total dose of 66 Gy. Two years later, the patient was admitted head, 
neck, chest, abdomen CT scan, and no progress or metastasis was detected after 
2-years follow-up.
DIAGNOSIS: Trichilemmal carcinoma of the periorbital region.
INTERVENTIONS: We describe the clinical characteristics, pathological features, 
and choice of examination methods of a patient with TLC in the periorbital 
region. And we use the radical radiotherapy to treat this case.
OUTCOMES: There are no progress or metastasis after 2-years follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy is a good option for patients with TLC if the patient 
refuses surgery or fails to achieve a satisfactory tumor-free margin or relapses 
after surgery.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000034038

chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) are characterized by 
coagulation necrosis; therefore, it is often difficult to distinguish 
enhancement in the arterial phase that would lead to false negative evaluation. 
This study aimed to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the difference 
value of multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in predicting 
residual tumor activity in HCC lesions after DEB-TACE. This retrospective 
diagnostic study analyzed CECT images of 73 HCC lesions in 57 patients 20 to 40 
days (average 28 days) after DEB-TACE treatment at our Hospital from January to 
December 2019. Postoperative pathology or digital subtraction angiography images 
were used as references. Residual tumor activity after the first intervention 
was determined based on the presence of tumor staining in digital subtraction 
angiography or the postoperative pathological discovery of HCC tumor cells. A 
significant difference was observed between the active and inactive residual 
groups in ∆ HU difference between CT values of arterial phase and non-contrast 
scans (AN, P = .000), difference between CT values of venous phase and 
non-contrast scans (VN, P = .000), difference between CT values of delay phase 
and non-contrast scans (DN, P = .000), (difference between CT values of venous 
and arterial phase scans, P = .001), and (difference between CT values of delay 
and arterial phase scans, P = .005). No statistically significant difference was 
observed between the delayed and venous phases (difference between CT values of 
delay and venous phase scans, P = .361). The area under the curve (AUC) of the 
ROC curve showed that the diagnostic efficacies in difference in CT value of AN 
(AUC = 0.976), VN (AUC = 0.927), and DN (AUC = 0.924) were higher, and their 
cutoff values were 4.86, 12.065, 20.19 HU with their sensitivities of 93.3%, 
84.4%, 77.8% and specificities of 100%, 96.4%, and 100%, respectively. 
difference in CT value values of AN, VN, DN, difference between CT values of 
venous and arterial phase scans and difference between CT values of delay and 
arterial phase scans can sensitively detect residual tumor activity 20-40 days 
after DEB-TACE. Thus, more sensitive active residual foci were detected using 
all 3 enhanced phases rather than only the arterial phase. Quantitative analysis 
of multiphase CECT can detect residual tumor activity in an early and 
noninvasive manner, which can provide time for patients to receive early 
follow-up treatment.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000034054

senescence-related genes (CSRGs) in breast cancer (BC) and establish a risk 
signature. Trascriptome data of CSRGs were obtained from the TCGA and GEO 
databases. Consensus clustering was used to generate CSRGs-based molecular 
clusters for BC patients. A CSRGs-derived risk signature was built using 
multiple Cox regression analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between clusters. The prognosis, immune infiltration, chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy response between different risk groups were analyzed and compared. 
Two molecular clusters of BC patients were generated on the basis of 79 
differentially expressed CSRGs, which showed distinct prognosis and immune 
infiltration. A total of 1403 DEGs between the CSRGs-derived clusters were 
found, and 10 of them were independent prognostic genes that used to construct a 
risk signature. The results demonstrated that patients with older age and 
advanced stage presented with a higher risk scores. In addition, the risk 
signature was found to be associated with outcomes, immune infiltration, 
chemotherapy and immunotherapy response. Patients in the low-risk group showed a 
favorable prognosis and higher immunotherapy response than those in the 
high-risk group. Finally, we developed a highly stable nomogram that 
incorporates risk signature, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and stage variables, 
enabling accurate prediction of the overall survival (OS) of individual 
patients. To conclude, the signature derived from CSRGs holds great promise as a 
biomarker for prognostic assessment of BC and may serve as a valuable tool in 
guiding immunotherapy.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000034018

with resected stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its 
effectiveness remains uncertain. This retrospective cohort study aimed to 
investigate the impact of PORT on overall survival (OS) and evaluate its 
heterogeneity among subgroups of patients.
METHODS: A total of 6305 patients with resected stage III NSCLC were included in 
this study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. 
Propensity score matching was conducted to balance baseline characteristics 
between the patients who received PORT and those who did not. OS was used as the 
primary outcome. Subgroup analysis was performed to identify which patient 
subgroups might benefit more from PORT.
RESULTS: Overall, no significant difference was observed in OS between the 2 
groups with or without propensity score matching. However, subgroup analysis 
demonstrated that PORT improved OS in patients with certain characteristics, 
including stage IIIA/N2, stage IIIB, squamous cell carcinoma, tumor grade 
III-IV, or lymph node ratio (LNR) > 1/3. Multivariate analysis showed that 
several variables were associated with adverse prognostic factors for OS, such 
as marital status (others), race (white), male gender, squamous cell carcinoma, 
elderly age, advanced stage, poor histological differentiation grade, high LNR, 
and not receiving chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: In patients with resected stage III NSCLC, PORT may not be 
beneficial for all patients. However, it may improve survival time in certain 
patient subgroups, such as those with stage IIIA/N2, stage IIIB, squamous cell 
carcinoma, tumor grade III to IV, or LNR > 1/3. These findings provide important 
information for clinical decision-making and future research regarding the use 
of PORT in patients with resected stage III NSCLC.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000034015

associated with consumption of oral contraceptives (Diane-35). We conducted a 
population-based, retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan National Health 
Insurance Research Database. From the database, 9865 women aged 18 to 65 years 
who were prescribed Diane-35 between 2000 and 2012 were included in the Diane-35 
group, and 39,460 women who were not prescribed Diane-35 were included in the 
comparison group and were frequency-matched by age and index year. Both groups 
were followed until 2013 to calculate the incidence of thyroid cancer. Hazard 
ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox 
proportional hazard model. The median (standard deviation) follow-up duration 
was 7.08 (3.63) and 7.04 (3.64) years in the Diane-35 and the comparison group, 
respectively. The incidence of thyroid cancer was 1.80-fold higher in the 
Diane-35 group than in the comparison group (2.72 vs 1.51 per 10,000 
person-years). The cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly 
higher in the Diane-35 group than in the comparison group (log-rank test, P = 
.03). An elevated hazard ratio of thyroid cancer was observed in the Diane-35 
group than in the comparison group (HR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.10-3.30). In subgroup 
analysis, patients aged 30 to 39 years showed a higher hazard ratio of 
developing thyroid cancer after consuming Diane-35 than those in the comparison 
group (HR: 5.58, 95% CI: 1.84-16.91). The study provides evidence that women 
aged 30 to 39 years consuming Diane-35 are at increased risk of thyroid cancer.

confirm causality.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000034074

(1)Department of Oncology, Binhaiwan Central Hospital, Dongguan, Guangdong, 
China.","RATIONALE: Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors are promising candidates for 
patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast 
cancer. However, current international guidelines recommend endocrine therapy 
alone or with HER2-targeted therapy to treat HER2-positive and hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in patients who cannot tolerate 
first-line chemotherapy. Moreover, data on the effectiveness and safety of 
cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors combined with trastuzumab and endocrine 
therapy as a first-line treatment for HER2-positive and HR-positive metastatic 
breast cancer are limited.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 50-year-old premenopausal woman was with epigastric pain for 
more than 20 days. Ten years ago, she was diagnosed with left breast cancer and 
underwent surgical treatment, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy.
DIAGNOSES: After relevant examination, the patient was diagnosed with liver, 
lung, and left cervical lymph node metastatic HER2-positive and HR-positive 
carcinoma from the left breast after systemic therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: The laboratory investigations showed that the patient's liver 
function was seriously damaged due to the liver metastases, and the patient was 
assessed as unable to tolerate chemotherapy. She was treated with trastuzumab, 
leuprorelin, letrozole, and piperacillin combined with percutaneous transhepatic 
cholangic drainage.
OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms were relieved, her liver function returned to 
normal, and the tumor showed partial response. Neutropenia (Grade 3) and 
thrombocytopenia (Grade 2) occurred during treatment but improved after 
symptomatic treatment. To date, the progression-free survival of the patient is 
over 14 months.
LESSONS: We believe that trastuzumab, leuprorelin, letrozole, and palbociclib is 
a feasible and effective treatment for HER2-positive and HR-positive metastatic 
breast cancer in premenopausal patients who cannot tolerate first-line 
chemotherapy.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000033975

T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and encodes a viral oncoprotein (Hbz) that is 
consistently expressed in asymptomatic carriers and ATL patients, suggesting its 
importance in the development and maintenance of HTLV-1 leukemic cells. Our 
previous work found Hbz protein is dispensable for virus-mediated T-cell 
immortalization but enhances viral persistence. We and others have also shown 
that hbz mRNA promotes T-cell proliferation. In our current studies, we 
evaluated the role of hbz mRNA on HTLV-1-mediated immortalization in vitro as 
well as in vivo persistence and disease development. We generated mutant 
proviral clones to examine the individual contributions of hbz mRNA, hbz mRNA 
secondary structure (stem-loop), and Hbz protein. Wild-type (WT) and all mutant 
viruses produced virions and immortalized T-cells in vitro. Viral persistence 
and disease development were also evaluated in vivo by infection of a rabbit 
model and humanized immune system (HIS) mice, respectively. Proviral load and 
sense and antisense viral gene expression were significantly lower in rabbits 
infected with mutant viruses lacking Hbz protein compared to WT or virus with an 
altered hbz mRNA stem-loop (M3 mutant). HIS mice infected with Hbz 
protein-deficient viruses showed significantly increased survival times compared 
to animals infected with WT or M3 mutant virus. Altered hbz mRNA secondary 
structure, or loss of hbz mRNA or protein, has no significant effect on T-cell 
immortalization induced by HTLV-1 in vitro; however, the Hbz protein plays a 
critical role in establishing viral persistence and leukemogenesis in vivo.","Copyright: © 2023 Maksimova et al. This is an open access article distributed

predominantly White patients. In African Americans, prostatic adenocarcinoma has 
a poorer prognosis, raising the possibility of distinct genetic alterations.
OBJECTIVE.—: To investigate the genomic alterations of prostatic adenocarcinoma 
metastatic to regional lymph nodes in African American patients, with an 
emphasis on SPOP mutation.
DESIGN.—: We retrospectively reviewed African American patients with pN1 
prostatic adenocarcinoma managed with radical prostatectomy and lymph node 
dissection. Comprehensive molecular profiling was performed, and androgen 
receptor signaling scores were calculated.
RESULTS.—: Nineteen patients were included. The most frequent genetic alteration 
was SPOP mutations (5 of 17; 29.4% [95% CI: 10.3-56.0]). While most alterations 
were associated with a high androgen receptor signaling score, mutant SPOP was 
exclusively associated with a low median and interquartile range (IQR) androgen 
receptor signaling score (0.788 [IQR 0.765-0.791] versus 0.835 [IQR 
0.828-0.842], P = .003). In mutant SPOP, mRNA expression of SPOP inhibitor G3BP1 
and SPOP substrates showed a significant decreased expression of AR (33.40 [IQR 
28.45-36.30] versus 59.53 [IQR 53.10-72.83], P = .01), TRIM24 (3.95 [IQR

10.59-15.93] versus 21.88 [IQR 18.41-28.33], P = .046).
CONCLUSIONS.—: African American patients with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma 
might have a higher prevalence of mutant SPOP (30%), compared to ∼10% in 
unselected cohorts with lower expressions of SPOP substrates. In our study, in 
patients with mutant SPOP, the mutation was associated with decreased SPOP

adequacy and triaging cytology samples. Although fine-needle aspiration biopsy 
(FNAB) is the primary method of initial tissue sampling in Tanzania, ROSE is not 
practiced.
OBJECTIVE.—: To investigate the performance of ROSE in determining cellular 
adequacy and providing preliminary diagnoses in breast FNAB in a low-resource 
setting.
DESIGN.—: Patients with breast masses were recruited prospectively from the FNAB 
clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital. Each FNAB was evaluated by ROSE for 
overall specimen adequacy, cellularity, and preliminary diagnosis. The 
preliminary interpretation was compared to the final cytologic diagnosis and 
histologic diagnosis, when available.
RESULTS.—: Fifty FNAB cases were evaluated, and all were adequate for diagnosis 
on ROSE and final interpretation. Overall percentage of agreement (OPA) between 
preliminary and final cytologic diagnosis was 86%, positive percentage of 
agreement (PPA) was 36%, and negative percentage of agreement (NPA) was 100% (κ 
= 0.5, P < .001). Twenty-one cases had correlating surgical resections. OPA 
between preliminary cytologic and histologic diagnoses was 67%, PPA was 22%, and 
NPA was 100% (κ = 0.2, P = .09). OPA between final cytologic and histologic 
diagnoses was 95%, PPA of 89%, and NPA of 100% (κ = 0.9, P = <.001).
CONCLUSIONS.—: False positive rates of ROSE diagnoses for breast FNAB are low. 
While preliminary cytologic diagnoses had a high false negative rate, final 
cytologic diagnoses had overall high concordance with histologic diagnoses. 
Therefore, the role of ROSE for preliminary diagnosis should be considered

have eosinophils and classically displays a lymphocytic infiltrate most 
concentrated around the tips of rete ridges. The differential diagnosis for HLP 
is broad and encompasses numerous entities in many different categories, 
including premalignant and malignant neoplasms, reactive squamoproliferative 
tumors, benign epidermal neoplasms, connective tissue disease, autoimmune 
bullous disease, infection, and drug-related reactions. Therefore, a high index

and its diagnosis is often challenging.
OBJECTIVE.—: To provide insights into state-of-the-art approaches for the 
diagnosis of CCA.
DATA SOURCES.—: Literature review via PubMed search and authors' experiences.
CONCLUSIONS.—: CCA can be categorized as intrahepatic or extrahepatic. 
Intrahepatic CCA is further classified into small-duct-type and large-duct-type, 
whereas extrahepatic CCA is classified into distal and perihilar according to 
site of origin within the extrahepatic biliary tree. Tumor growth patterns 
include mass forming, periductal infiltrating, and intraductal tumors. The 
clinical diagnosis of CCA is challenging and usually occurs at an advanced tumor 
stage. Pathologic diagnosis is made difficult by tumor inaccessibility and 
challenges in distinguishing CCA from metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver. 
Immunohistochemical stains can assist in differentiating CCA from other 
malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, but no distinctive CCA-specific 
immunohistochemical profile has been identified. Recent advances in 
next-generation sequencing-based high-throughput assays have identified distinct 
genomic profiles of CCA subtypes, including genomic alterations that are 
susceptible to targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Detailed 
histopathologic and molecular evaluations of CCA by pathologists are critical 
for correct diagnosis, subclassification, therapeutic decision-making, and 
prognostication. The first step toward achieving these goals is to acquire a 
detailed understanding of the histologic and genetic subtypes of this 
heterogeneous tumor group. Here, we review state-of-the-art approaches that 
should be applied to establish a diagnosis of CCA, including clinical 
presentation, histopathology, staging, and the practical use of genetic testing 
methodologies.",© 2023 College of American Pathologists.,"DOI: 10.5858/arpa.2022-0537-RA

U.S. men, nearly one-half of whom have at least moderate symptoms. Sedentary 
lifestyle, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus increase risk of symptoms. 
Evaluation is focused on determining severity of symptoms and therapy to improve 
symptoms. Rectal examination has limited accuracy in evaluating prostate size. 
Transrectal ultrasonography is preferred to verify size when starting 5-alpha 
reductase therapy or considering surgery. Serum prostate-specific antigen 
testing is not recommended in routine evaluation of lower urinary tract 
symptoms, and shared decision-making should be used for cancer screening 
decisions. The International Prostate Symptom Score is the best way to track 
symptoms. Self-management methods, including limiting evening fluid intake, 
reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, toilet and bladder training, pelvic floor 
exercises, and mindfulness techniques, can improve symptoms. Although saw 
palmetto is not effective, the herbal treatments Pygeum africanum and 
beta-sitosterol may be effective. Primary medical treatment involves alpha 
blockers or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Alpha blockers offer rapid benefit 
and can be used for acute urinary retention. Combining alpha blockers and 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors is not beneficial. For uncontrolled symptoms, 
5-alpha reductase inhibitors should be started if the prostate volume is 30 mL 
or greater by ultrasonography. 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors take up to one year 
to be fully beneficial and are more effective when taken with alpha blockers.

transurethral resection of the prostate improves symptoms, many less invasive 
options with varying effectiveness can be considered.",PMID: 37327163

California.","OBJECTIVE: Pediatric primary brain tumors are the leading cause of death among 
childhood cancers. Guidelines recommend specialized care with a 
multidisciplinary team and focused treatment protocols to optimize outcomes in 
this patient population. Furthermore, readmission is a key metric of patient 
outcomes and has been used to inform reimbursement. However, no prior study has 
analyzed national database-level records to evaluate the role of care in a 
designated children's hospital following pediatric tumor resection and its 
impact on readmission rates. The goal of this study was to investigate whether 
treatment at a children's hospital rather than a nonchildren's hospital has a 
significant effect on outcome.
METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database records from 2010 to 2018 were 
analyzed retrospectively to evaluate the effect of hospital designation on 
patient outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor resection, and results are 
reported as national estimates. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses 
of patient and hospital characteristics were conducted to evaluate if craniotomy 
for tumor resection at a designated children's hospital was independently 
associated with 30-day readmissions, mortality rate, and length of stay.
RESULTS: A total of 4003 patients who underwent craniotomy for tumor resection 
were identified using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, with 1258 of these 
cases (31.4%) treated at children's hospitals. Patients treated at children's 
hospitals were associated with decreased likelihood of 30-day hospital 
readmission (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.97, p = 0.036) compared to patients treated 
at nonchildren's hospitals. There was no significant difference in index 
mortality between patients treated at children's hospitals and those treated at 
nonchildren's hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that patients undergoing craniotomy for tumor 
resection at children's hospitals were associated with decreased rates of 30-day 
readmission, with no significant difference in index mortality. Future 
prospective studies may be warranted to confirm this association and identify 
components contributing to improved outcomes in care at children's hospitals.","DOI: 10.3171/2023.4.PEDS2364

urged the update of previous diagnostic and prognostic schemes, which resulted 
in the development, in 2022, of the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
International Consensus Classification (ICC) and the new European LeukemiaNet 
(ELN) recommendations. We aimed to provide a real-world application of the new 
models, to unravel differences and similarities, and to test their 
implementation in clinical AML diagnosis. A total of 1001 patients diagnosed 
with AML were re-classified according to the new schemes. The overall diagnostic 
changes between the WHO 2016, compared to WHO 2022 and ICC classifications were 
22.8% and 23.7%, respectively, with a 13.1% difference in patients' distribution 
between ICC and WHO 2022. The 2022 ICC ""not otherwise specified"" and WHO 
""defined by differentiation"" AML categories shrank as compared to WHO 2016

the myelodysplasia (MDS)-related group. Of 397 patients with a MDS-related AML 
according to the ICC, 55.9% were defined by the presence of a MDS-related 
karyotype. The overall re-stratification between ELN 2017 and 2022 was 12.9%. 
The 2022 AML classifications led to a significant improvement of diagnostic 
schemes. In the real-world setting, conventional cytogenetics, usually rapidly

secretory lysosomes. To address this possibility, we performed a high-resolution 
analysis of KIR and HLA-class I genes in 365 blood donors and linked genotypes

mapping of surface receptors and lysosomal effector molecules revealed that 
DNAM-1 and granzyme B levels served as a robust metric of the functional state

Identifying cell surface markers specifically expressed in chemoresistant cancer 
cells (CCCs) could facilitate targeted therapies to overcome chemoresistance. We 
performed an antibody-based screen and found that TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81, two 
'stemness' cell surface markers, are highly enriched in CCCs. Furthermore, 
TRA-1-60+/TRA-1-81+ cells are chemoresistant compared to TRA-1-60-/TRA-1-81- 
cells. Transcriptome profiling identified UGT1A10, shown to be both necessary 
and sufficient to maintain TRA-1-60/TRA-1-81 expression and chemoresistance. 
From a high-content chemical screen, we identified Cymarin, which downregulates 
UGT1A10, eliminates TRA-1-60/TRA-1-81 expression, and increases chemosensitivity 
both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, TRA-1-60/TRA-1-81 expression is highly 
specific in primary cancer tissue and positively correlated with chemoresistance 
and short survival, which highlights their potentiality for targeted therapy.

prognosis for women diagnosed with breast cancer. A surrogate marker used to 
detect the spread of disease after treatment of breast cancer is local and 
regional recurrence. The risk of local and regional recurrence after mastectomy 
increases with the number of axillary lymph nodes affected by cancer. There is a 
consensus to use radiotherapy as an adjuvant treatment after mastectomy 
(postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT)) in women diagnosed with breast cancer and 
found to have disease in four or more positive axillary lymph nodes. Despite 
data showing almost double the risk of local and regional recurrence in women 
treated with mastectomy and found to have one to three positive lymph nodes, 
there is a lack of international consensus on the use of PMRT in this group.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of PMRT in women diagnosed with early breast 
cancer and found to have one to three positive axillary lymph nodes.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised 
Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov 
up to 24 September 2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The 
inclusion criteria included women diagnosed with breast cancer treated with 
simple or modified radical mastectomy and axillary surgery (sentinel lymph node 
biopsy (SLNB) alone or those undergoing axillary lymph node clearance with or 
without prior SLNB). We included only women receiving PMRT using X-rays 
(electron and photon radiation), and we defined the radiotherapy dose to reflect 
what is currently being recommended (i.e. 40 Gray (Gy) to 50 Gy in 15 to 25/28 
fractions in 3 to 5 weeks. The included studies did not administer any boost to 
the tumour bed. In this review, we excluded studies using neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy as a supportive treatment before surgery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Covidence to screen records. We collected 
data on tumour characteristics, adjuvant treatments and the outcomes of local 
and regional recurrence, overall survival, disease-free survival, time to 
progression, short- and long-term adverse events and quality of life. We 
reported on time-to-event outcome measures using the hazard ratio (HR) and 
subdistribution HR. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool (RoB 1), and we 
presented overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: The RCTs included in this review were subgroup analyses of 
original RCTs conducted in the 1980s to assess the effectiveness of PMRT. Hence, 
the type and duration of adjuvant systemic treatments used in the studies 
included in this review were suboptimal compared to the current standard of 
care. The review involved three RCTs with a total of 829 women diagnosed with 
breast cancer and low-volume axillary disease. Amongst the included studies, 
only a single study pertained to the modern-day radiotherapy practice. The 
results from this one study showed a reduction of local and regional recurrence 
(HR 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.33, 1 study, 522 women; 
low-certainty evidence) and improvement in overall survival with PMRT (HR 0.76, 
95% CI 0.60 to 0.97, 1 study, 522 women; moderate-certainty evidence). One of 
the other studies using radiotherapy techniques that do not reflect modern-day 
practice reported on disease-free survival in women with low-volume axillary 
disease (subdistribution HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96, 1 study, 173 women). None 
of the included studies reported on PMRT side effects or quality-of-life outcome 
measures.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on one study, the use of PMRT in women diagnosed 
with breast cancer and low-volume axillary disease indicated a reduction in 
locoregional recurrence and an improvement in survival. There is a need for more 
research to be conducted using modern-day radiotherapy equipment and methods to 
support and supplement the review findings.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published

BEV resistance is often observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to 
identify the genes responsible for BEV resistance. C57BL/6 mice inoculated with 
ID-8 murine OC cells were treated with anti-VEGFA antibody or IgG (control) 
twice weekly for four weeks. The mice were sacrificed, then, RNA was extracted 
from the disseminated tumors. qRT-PCR assays were performed to identify 
angiogenesis-related genes and miRNAs that were altered by anti-VEGFA treatment. 
SERPINE1/PAI-1 was found to be upregulated during BEV treatment. Therefore, we 
focused on miRNAs to elucidate the mechanism underlying the upregulation of 
PAI-1 during BEV treatment. Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis revealed that higher 
expression levels of SERPINE1/PAI-1 were associated with poor prognoses among 
BEV-treated patients, suggesting that SERPINE1/PAI may be involved in the 
acquisition of BEV resistance. miRNA microarray analysis followed by in silico 
and functional assays revealed that miR-143-3p targeted SERPINE1 and negatively 
regulated PAI-1 expression. The transfection of miR-143-3p suppressed PAI-1 
secretion from OC cells and inhibited in vitro angiogenesis in HUVECs. Next, 
miR-143-3p-overexpressing ES2 cells were intraperitoneally injected into BALB/c 
nude mice. ES2-miR-143-3p cells downregulated PAI-1 production, attenuated 
angiogenesis, and significantly inhibited intraperitoneal tumor growth following 
treatment with anti-VEGFA antibody. Continuous anti-VEGFA treatment 
downregulated miR-143-3p expression, which upregulated PAI-1 and activated an 
alternative angiogenic pathway in OC. In conclusion, the substitution of this 
miRNA during BEV treatment may help overcome BEV resistance, and this may be 
used as a novel treatment strategy in clinical settings. Implications: 
Continuous administration of VEGFA antibody upregulates SERPINE1/PAI1 expression 
via the downregulation of miR-143-3p, which contributes to acquiring bevacizumab 
resistance in ovarian cancer.","DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-23-0015

the heaviest burden of cancer among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (defined 
as age 15-39 years). A larger proportion of the population in Asia is aged 15-39 
compared with the developed countries. This age group is different from the 
pediatric or the adult group in terms of physical, social, psychological, and 
financial needs. Cancer incidence, disability, survivorship needs, financial 
toxicity, psychosocial issues, and so on are underestimated in this group, and 
available literature is scarce. Global data show an increasing trend of 
adult-onset cancers such as colorectal, breast, pancreas, and lung in the AYA 
population. Data suggest that the disease biology and prognosis are different in 
this group; however, further research is needed. An ESMO/SIOPE/SIOP Asia survey 
on the care of AYA cancer patients in Asia found a suboptimal availability of 
AYA specialized centers in the region and identified several unmet needs 
including lack of training, clinical trials, and high rates of treatment 
abandonment. There is an urgent need for cancer care systems in Asia to develop 
specialized services to be able to cater to this growing burden. Training and 
research in this area also need to be upscaled with the goal of establishing a 
sustainable infrastructure and quality services to ensure that this vulnerable 
group receives appropriate care. Management guidelines and national health 
policies should consider giving special attention to this group as the World

volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is transferred to another beam-matched 
linac. To evaluate the performance of Accelerated Go Live (AGL) service, the 
measured beam characteristics and patient specific quality assurance (QA) 
results between two AGL-matched linacs were compared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two VersaHD linacs were installed using the AGL service. 
After the installation, the beam data such as percentage depth dose (PDD), 
lateral profiles and output factors for all photon beams were measured. Relative 
doses were also measured as a function of the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) leaf 
gap width. Subsequently, VMAT plans were created for prostate, pelvis, head and 
neck, liver, lung cancers and multiple brain metastases. Dose distributions and 
point doses were measured by multi-dimensional detectors and ionization chambers 
for patient specific quality assurance, and comparisons were made between the 
two linacs.
RESULTS: Dose differences in PDDs were all within ± 1% except the entrance 
region, and the averaged gamma indices of the lateral profiles were within 0.3. 
The differences in doses as a function of the MLC leaf gap width between the two 
linacs were within ±0.5%. For all the plans, gamma passing rates were all higher 
than 95% with criteria of 2%/2 mm. The average and the SD of dose differences on 
the multi-dimensional detector between both measurements was 0.06 ± 2.12%, and 
the average of point dose differences was -0.03 ± 0.33%.
CONCLUSION: We have evaluated the AGL performance in the context of beam 
characteristics and patient specific QA. It was demonstrated that the AGL 
service provides an accurate VMAT treatment reproducibility for many tumor sites 
with gamma pass rates greater than 95% under criteria of 2%/2 mm.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics published by

and inflammatory dietary patterns have been associated with colorectal cancer 
risk, these dietary patterns have not been studied in relation to adenoma risk.
METHODS: Using data from 21,192 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, 
and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer screening cohort, we calculated the Empirical Dietary 
Index for Hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) 
and overall dietary quality measured via the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015), 
from food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). In multivariable-adjusted logistic 
regression, we investigated associations of these dietary indices with adenoma 
(any adenoma, advanced adenoma, n=19,493), and recurrent adenoma (n=1,699).
RESULTS: EDIH was not associated with adenoma or advanced adenoma but was 
marginally associated with recurrent adenoma. The OR (95%CI) comparing highest 
(lowest insulinemic) versus lowest (most hyperinsulinemic) quintiles was 0.76 
(0.55, 1.05) after multivariable adjustment including BMI. EDIP and HEI-2015 
were not associated with any of the three outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In the PLCO cohort, we did not observe substantial associations 
between dietary patterns and risk of colorectal adenomas.
IMPACT: Pending confirmation in larger prospective studies, our findings suggest 
that these dietary patterns may not substantially affect colorectal cancer risk 
via the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.","DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-23-0143

but it can prove challenging. Although evidence-based smoking cessation 
interventions exist and are effective, a lack of access to these interventions 
specifically designed for young adults remains a major barrier for this 
population to successfully quit smoking. Therefore, researchers have begun to 
develop modern, smartphone-based interventions to deliver smoking cessation 
messages at the appropriate place and time for an individual. A promising 
approach is the delivery of interventions using geofences-spatial buffers around 
high-risk locations for smoking that trigger intervention messages when an 
individual's phone enters the perimeter. Despite growth in personalized and 
ubiquitous smoking cessation interventions, few studies have incorporated 
spatial methods to optimize intervention delivery using place and time 
information.
OBJECTIVE: This study demonstrates an exploratory method of generating 
person-specific geofences around high-risk areas for smoking by presenting 4 
case studies using a combination of self-reported smartphone-based surveys and 
passively tracked location data. The study also examines which geofence 
construction method could inform a subsequent study design that will automate 
the process of deploying coping messages when young adults enter geofence 
boundaries.
METHODS: Data came from an ecological momentary assessment study with young 
adult smokers conducted from 2016 to 2017 in the San Francisco Bay area. 
Participants reported smoking and nonsmoking events through a smartphone app for 
30 days, and GPS data was recorded by the app. We sampled 4 cases along 
ecological momentary assessment compliance quartiles and constructed 
person-specific geofences around locations with self-reported smoking events for 
each 3-hour time interval using zones with normalized mean kernel density 
estimates exceeding 0.7. We assessed the percentage of smoking events captured 
within geofences constructed for 3 types of zones (census blocks, 500 ft2 
fishnet grids, and 1000 ft2 fishnet grids). Descriptive comparisons were made 
across the 4 cases to better understand the strengths and limitations of each 
geofence construction method.
RESULTS: The number of reported past 30-day smoking events ranged from 12 to 177 
for the 4 cases. Each 3-hour geofence for 3 of the 4 cases captured over 50% of 
smoking events. The 1000 ft2 fishnet grid captured the highest percentage of 
smoking events compared to census blocks across the 4 cases. Across 3-hour 
periods except for 3:00 AM-5:59 AM for 1 case, geofences contained an average of 
36.4%-100% of smoking events. Findings showed that fishnet grid geofences may 
capture more smoking events compared to census blocks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that this geofence construction method can 
identify high-risk smoking situations by time and place and has potential for 
generating individually tailored geofences for smoking cessation intervention 
delivery. In a subsequent smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, 
we plan to use fishnet grid geofences to inform the delivery of intervention 
messages.","©Amanda Luken, Michael R Desjardins, Meghan B Moran, Tamar Mendelson, Vadim

neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for advanced ovarian cancer predominantly 
included patients with high-grade serous carcinomas. The use and outcomes of 
NACT in less common epithelial carcinomas are understudied.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the uptake and survival outcomes in treatment with 
NACT for less common histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study and systematic 
literature review with meta-analysis was conducted using the National Cancer 
Database from 2006 to 2017 and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results Program from 2006 to 2019. Data analysis was 
performed from July 2022 to April 2023. The evaluation included patients with 
stage III to IV ovarian cancer with clear cell, mucinous, or low-grade serous 
histologic subtypes who received multimodal treatment with surgery and 
chemotherapy.
EXPOSURES: Exposure assignment per the sequence of treatment: primary debulking 
surgery (PDS) followed by chemotherapy (PDS group) or NACT followed by interval 
surgery (NACT group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Temporal trends and characteristics of NACT use were 
assessed using multivariable analysis, and overall survival (OS) was assessed 
with the inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score.
RESULTS: A total of 3880 patients were examined in the National Cancer Database 
including 1829 women (median age, 56 [IQR, 49-63] years) with clear cell, 1156 
women (median age, 53 [IQR, 42-64] years) with low-grade serous, and 895 women 
(median age, 57 [IQR, 48-66] years) with mucinous carcinomas. NACT use increased 
in patients with clear cell (from 10.2% to 16.2%, 58.8% relative increase; 
P < .001 for trend) or low-grade serous (from 7.7% to 14.2%, 84.4% relative 
increase; P = .007 for trend) carcinoma during the study period. This 
association remained consistent in multivariable analysis. NACT use also 
increased, but nonsignificantly, in mucinous carcinomas (from 8.6% to 13.9%, 
61.6% relative increase; P = .07 for trend). Across the 3 histologic subtypes, 
older age and stage IV disease were independently associated with NACT use. In a 
propensity score-weighted model, the NACT and PDS groups had comparable OS for 
clear cell (4-year rates, 31.4% vs 37.7%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95% CI, 
0.95-1.33) and mucinous (27.0% vs 26.7%; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.68-1.19) 
carcinomas. For patients with low-grade serous carcinoma, NACT was associated 
with decreased OS compared with PDS (4-year rates, 56.4% vs 81.0%; HR, 2.12; 95% 
CI, 1.55-2.90). Increasing NACT use and histologic subtype-specific survival 
association were also found in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
Program cohort (n = 1447). A meta-analysis of 4 studies, including the current 
study, observed similar OS associations for clear cell (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 
0.96-1.34; 2 studies), mucinous (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71-1.21; 2 studies), and 
low-grade serous (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.63-2.74; 3 studies) carcinomas.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the lack of data on outcomes of NACT among 
patients with less common carcinomas, this study noted that NACT use for 
advanced disease has gradually increased in the US. Primary chemotherapy for 
advanced-stage, low-grade serous ovarian cancer may be associated with worse 
survival compared with PDS.","DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18602

suggested 70 years ago. However, to date, no conclusive evidence is available on 
this topic.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the 
association of meningioma with breast cancer, supported by a meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic PubMed search was performed up to April 2023 to 
identify articles on the association of meningioma with breast cancer. The 
following key words were used strategically: meningioma, breast cancer, breast 
carcinoma, association, relation.
STUDY SELECTION: All studies reporting women diagnosed with meningioma and 
breast cancer were identified. The search strategy was not limited by study 
design or publication date but only included articles in English. Additional 
articles were identified via citation searching. Studies reporting a complete 
population of meningiomas or breast cancer patients throughout a specific study 
period and a proportion of patients with a second pathology could be used for 
the meta-analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction was performed by 2 authors in 
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) 
statement. Meta-analyses regarding both populations were performed using a 
random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main measures were whether there was an 
increased prevalence of breast cancer in female patients with meningioma and 
whether there was an increased prevalence of meningioma in female patients with 
breast cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 51 retrospective studies (case reports, case series, and 
cancer registry reports) describing 2238 patients with both diseases were 
identified; 18 studies qualified for prevalence analyses and meta-analysis. The 
random-effects meta-analysis (13 studies) revealed a significantly greater 
prevalence of breast cancer in female patients with meningioma than in the 
overall population (odds ratio [OR], 9.87; 95% CI, 7.31-13.32). Meningioma 
incidence in patients with breast cancer (11 studies) was greater than that in 
the baseline population; however, the difference according to the random-effects 
model was not statistically significant (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.99-2.02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This large systematic review and the meta-analysis on 
the association between meningioma and breast cancer found nearly 10-fold higher 
odds of breast cancer in female patients with meningioma compared with the 
general female population. These findings suggest that female patients with 
meningioma should be screened more intensively for breast cancer. Further 
research is required to identify the factors causing this association.","DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18620

to barriers such as cost, insurance status, access to care, and transportation. 
Because these barriers are minimized within the Veterans Affairs system, there 
is a question of whether similar racial disparities exist within a Veterans 
Affairs health care system in North Carolina.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether racial disparities in completing LCS after 
referral exist at the Durham Veterans Affairs Health Care System (DVAHCS) and, 
if so, what factors are associated with screening completion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study assessed veterans 
referred to LCS between July 1, 2013, and August 31, 2021, at the DVAHCS. All 
included veterans self-identified as White or Black and met the US Preventive 
Services Task Force eligibility criteria as of January 1, 2021. Participants who 
died within 15 months of consultation or who were screened before consultation 
were excluded.
EXPOSURES: Self-reported race.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Screening completion was defined as completing 
computed tomography for LCS. The associations among screening completion, race, 
and demographic and socioeconomic risk factors were assessed using logistic 
regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 4562 veterans (mean [SD] age, 65.4 [5.7] years; 4296 [94.2%] 
male; 1766 [38.7%] Black and 2796 [61.3%] White) were referred for LCS. Of all 
veterans referred, 1692 (37.1%) ultimately completed screening; 2707 (59.3%) 
never connected with the LCS program after referral and an informational mailer 
or telephone call, indicating a critical point in the LCS process. Screening 
rates were substantially lower among Black compared with White veterans (538 
[30.5%] vs 1154 [41.3%]), with Black veterans having 0.66 times lower odds (95% 
CI, 0.54-0.80) of screening completion after adjusting for demographic and 
socioeconomic factors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that after referral 
for initial LCS via a centralized program, Black veterans had 34% lower odds of 
LCS screening completion compared with White veterans, a disparity that 
persisted even after accounting for numerous demographic and socioeconomic 
factors. A critical point in the screening process was when veterans must 
connect with the screening program after referral. These findings may be used to 
design, implement, and evaluate interventions to improve LCS rates among Black 
veterans.","DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18795

occupational cholangiocarcinoma in printing workers in Japan. However, the 
cellular and molecular mechanisms of 1,2-DCP-induced carcinogenesis remains 
elusive. The present study investigated cellular proliferation, DNA damage, 
apoptosis and expression of antioxidant and proinflammatory genes in the liver 
of mice exposed daily to 1,2-DCP for 5 weeks, and the role of Nrf2 in these 
responses. Wild-type and Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2-/-) mice were administered 1,2-DCP 
by gastric gavage, and then the livers were collected for analysis. 
Immunohistochemistry for BrdU or KI67 and TUNEL assay revealed that exposure to 
1,2-DCP dose-dependently increased proliferative cholangiocytes, while decreased 
apoptotic cholangiocytes in wild-type mice but not in Nrf2-/- mice. Western blot 
and quantitative real time PCR showed that exposure to 1,2-DCP increased the 
levels of DNA double-strand break marker γ-H2AX and mRNA expression levels of 
NQO1, xCT, GSTM1, and G6PD in the livers of wild-type mice in a dose-dependent 
manner, but no such changes were noted in Nrf2-/- mice. 1,2-DCP increased 
glutathione levels in the liver of both the wild-type and Nrf2-/- mice, 
suggesting that a Nrf2-independent mechanism contributes to 1,2-DCP-induced 
increase in glutathione level. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that 
exposure to 1,2-DCP induced proliferation but reduced apoptosis in 
cholangiocytes, and induced double-strand DNA breaks and upregulation of 
antioxidant genes in the liver in an Nrf2-dependent manner. The study suggests a 
role of Nrf2 in 1,2-DCP-induced cell proliferation, antiapoptotic effect and DNA 
damage which are recognized as key characteristics of carcinogens.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

career disruption and, consequently, loss of income and depletion of savings.
DESIGN: This study followed a qualitative descriptive design that allowed us to 
understand the characteristics and trends of the participants.
METHOD: Patients recruited (n = 20) for this study were part of the KU Cancer 
Center patient advocacy research group (PIVOT). The inclusion criteria were that 
participants must: be cancer survivors or co-survivors, be 18 years or older 
(age > =18), be either employed or a student at the time of cancer diagnosis, 
have completed their cancer treatment, and be in remission. The responses were 
transcribed and coded inductively to identify themes. A thematic network was 
constructed based on those themes, allowing us to explore and describe the 
intricacies of the various themes and their impacts.
RESULTS: Most patients had to quit their jobs or take extended absences from 
work to handle treatment challenges. Patients employed by the same employer for 
longer durations had the most flexibility to balance their time between cancer 
treatment and work. Essential, actionable items suggested by the cancer 
survivors included disseminating information about coping with financial burdens 
and ensuring that a nurse and financial navigator were assigned to every cancer 
patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Career disruption is common among cancer patients, and the 
financial burden due to their career trajectory is irreparable. The financial 
burden is more prominent in younger cancer patients and creates a cascading 
effect that financially affects close family members.",© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.,"DOI: 10.1093/jncics/pkad044

insights, in addition to accurate predictions, are of great interest to the 
biomedical community. Recently, interpretable DL models that incorporate 
signaling pathways have been proposed for drug response prediction. While these 
models improve interpretability, it is unclear whether this comes at the cost of 
less accurate drug response predictions, or a prediction improvement can also be 
obtained.
RESULTS: We comprehensively and systematically assessed four state-of-the-art 
interpretable DL models using three pathway collections to assess their ability 
in making accurate predictions on unseen samples from the same dataset, as well 
as their generalizability to an independent dataset. Our results showed that 
models that explicitly incorporate pathway information in the form of a latent 
layer perform worse compared to models that incorporate this information 
implicitly. However, in most evaluation setups, the best performance was 
achieved using a black-box multi-layer perceptron, and the performance of a 
random forests baseline was comparable to those of the interpretable models. 
Replacing the signaling pathways with randomly generated pathways showed a 
comparable performance for the majority of the models. Finally, the performance 
of all models deteriorated when applied to an independent dataset. These results 
highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of newly proposed models using 
carefully selected baselines. We provide different evaluation setups and 
baseline models that can be used to achieve this goal.

therapies, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine 
(T-DM1). A reported association of Asian ancestry with this event merits 
investigation to rule out potential confounding.
METHODS: Subjects in this retrospective cohort were female patients with HER2 
positive breast cancer, of Asian or non-Hispanic White ancestry, who initiated 
T-DM1 or T-DXd from January 2017 through October 2021. Follow-up closed in 
January 2022. Primary endpoint was dose adjustment for thrombocytopenia. 
Competing endpoints were discontinuation of drug for other toxicity, disease 
progression, or for completion of prescribed cycles. The association between 
Asian ancestry and thrombocytopenia-related dose adjustment was tested at 
p < 0.01 in a proportional hazards model for the sub-distributions of 4 (primary 
and competing) endpoints. Covariates examined as potential confounders were age, 
metastatic disease, specific HER2-targeted drug, and prior drug switching for 
toxicity.
RESULTS: Among 181 subjects, 48 reported Asian ancestry. Incidence of dose 
adjustment for thrombocytopenia was higher in patients with Asian ancestry and 
among patients switched to T-DXd after experiencing thrombocytopenia on T-DM1. 
Independent of specific drug and prior drug switching, Asian ancestry was 
associated with dose adjustment for thrombocytopenia (hazards ratio 2.95, 95% 
confidence interval 1.41-6.18) but not with competing endpoints. Among 
participants of Asian ancestry, the ancestral origin was usually China or the 
Philippines (where Chinese ancestry is common).
CONCLUSIONS: The association between Asian ancestry and thrombocytopenia on 
HER2-targeted therapy is independent of age, metastatic disease, drug, and 
history of similar toxicity. This association may have a genetic basis linked to 
Chinese ancestry.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s12282-023-01473-2

are lower than older Australian women, however, little research has been 
conducted to understand why. This study aimed to identify and explore the 
barriers and enablers faced by young Victorians with a cervix to regular 
cervical screening.
METHODS: This study used a mixed method exploratory design consisting of 
qualitative focus groups and a quantitative online survey. Four focus groups 
were conducted with 24 Victorians with a cervix aged between 25 and 35. 
Barriers, enablers and knowledge of cervical screening were explored. Focus 
groups were recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis of common themes. A 
supporting online survey was completed by 98 respondents. Summary statistics 
were analysed for differences in age.
RESULTS: Focus groups and the online survey revealed four main factors that 
influence young people's cervical screening behaviour. These include past 
negative screening experiences, practitioner factors, priority placed on 
cervical screening, and cervical screening knowledge. These factors differ to 
the opinions of people older than 35, with young people focusing more on the 
psychological elements of cervical screening compared with practical factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This research provides a unique insight into cervical screening 
barriers faced by women and people with a cervix aged between 25 and 35 as well 
as what factors motivate them to screen. SO WHAT?: These findings should be 
utilised to inform the design of public health campaign messaging targeting this 
age demographic. Findings can also assist practitioners to improve how they

its late diagnosis and extensive metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the 
effects of GABRP on pancreatic cancer metastasis and the molecular mechanism. 
The expression of GABRP was measured using the quantitative real-time PCR and 
western blot. The biological behaviors of cancer cells were assessed using the 
cell counting kit-8, Transwell assay, and western blot. The regulation of GABRP 
on the MEK/ERK pathway was detected by western blot. The results indicated that 
GABRP was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of 
GABRP suppressed cell viability, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), whereas GABRP overexpression facilitated these biological 
behaviors. Inactivation of the MEK/ERK pathway reversed the effects on cellular 
processes induced by GABRP. Moreover, silencing of GABRP inhibited tumor growth. 
In conclusion, GABRP promoted the progression of pancreatic cancer by 
facilitating cell metastasis and tumor growth via activating the MEK/ERK 
pathway. The findings suggest that GABRP has the potential to be a therapeutic 
target for the metastatic pancreatic cancer.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: Metabolic disorders are regarded as hallmarks of multiple myeloma 
(MM) and are responsible for rapid cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. 
However, the exact biological roles of metabolites in MM cells have not been 
fully explored. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and clinical 
significance of lactate for MM and investigate the molecular mechanism of lactic 
acid (Lac) in the proliferation of myeloma cells and cell sensitivity to 
bortezomib (BTZ).
METHODS: Metabolomic analysis of the serum was carried out to obtain metabolites 
expression and clinical characteristics in MM patients. The CCK8 assay and flow 
cytometry were used to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle 
changes. Western blotting was used to detect the potential mechanism and 
apoptosis- and cycle-related protein changes.
RESULTS: Lactate was highly expressed in both the peripheral blood and bone 
marrow of MM patients. It was significantly correlated with Durie-Salmon Staging 
(DS Staging) and the International Staging System (ISS Staging) and the serum 
and urinary involved/uninvolved free light chain ratios. Patients with 
relatively high lactate levels had a poor treatment response. Moreover, in vitro 
experiments showed that Lac could promote the proliferation of tumor cells and 
decrease the proportion of G0/G1-phase cells, which was accompanied by an 
increased proportion of S-phase cells. In addition, Lac could decrease tumor 
sensitivity to BTZ by disrupting the expression of nuclear factor kappa B 
subunit 2 (NFkB2) and RelB.
CONCLUSION: Metabolic changes are important in MM cell proliferation and 
treatment response; lactate could be used as a biomarker in MM and as a 
therapeutic target to overcome cell resistance to BTZ.",© 2023. Huazhong University of Science and Technology.,"DOI: 10.1007/s11596-023-2747-0

encountered tumor. Little information is available about the treatment and 
prognosis of this rare disease in children. This study was undertaken to 
elucidate the clinical-radiological characteristics and treatment outcomes of 
pediatric patients with atypical EVN.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients' demographic features, treatment 
modalities, and outcomes in our institution from January 2011 to December 2019 
was conducted.
RESULTS: Seven consecutive children harboring atypical EVN in our center were 
included, with a male predominance (n = 5, 71.4%) and a mean age of 
11.8 ± 4.9 years (range: 2-18 years). The lesions mainly involved the frontal 
(n = 4, 57.1%) and temporal lobes (n = 4, 57.1%). Gross total resection (GTR) 
was achieved in 6 patients (85.7%), and subtotal resection (STR) was achieved in 
the remaining patient (14.3%). All lesions demonstrated a high Ki-67 index (≧5%) 
and atypical features pathologically. Five patients (71.4%) received 
radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy after surgery. During follow-up, 5 patients 
(71.4%) experienced lesion progression, and 2 (14.3%) of them died. The median 
progression-free survival was 48 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of pediatric patients with atypical EVN was dismal 
after aggressive treatment. Most tumors progressed, and this progression was 
positively correlated with the Ki-67 index. Surgical excision is the main 
treatment modality for atypical EVN, and radiation/chemotherapy should also be 
introduced after surgery.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

atherosclerosis on Doppler ultrasonography and postoperative delirium (POD) in 
patients undergoing spinal surgery.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study using prospectively collected 
data, 295 consecutive patients aged > 50 years underwent spine surgery at a 
single institution between March 2015 and February 2021. Cervical 
atherosclerosis was defined as the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common 
carotid artery (CCA) being ≥ 1.1 mm on pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with the 
prevalence of postoperative delirium as a dependent variable. Age, sex, body 
mass index, medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical 
Status (ASA-PS), CHADS2 score (an assessment score for stroke), instrumentation, 
duration of surgery, blood loss, and cervical arteriosclerosis were the 
independent variables.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients of 295 (9.2%) developed delirium postoperatively. 
Forty-one (13.9%) of the 295 patients had cervical atherosclerosis. Their 
univariate analyses showed that age (P = 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.016), 
cancer (P = 0.046), antiplatelet agent use (P < 0.001), ASA-PS ≥ 3 (P < 0.001), 
CHADS2 score (P < 0.001), cervical atherosclerosis (P = 0.008), and right 
CCA-IMT (P = 0.007) were significantly associated with POD. However, 
multivariate logistic regression analyses showed older age (odds ratio [OR], 
1.109; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.035-1.188; P = 0.03) and antiplatelet 
agent use (OR, 3.472; 95% CI 1.221-9.870; P = 0.020) to be significantly 
associated with POD.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant association between POD and the prevalence 
of cervical atherosclerosis using the univariate logistic regression analysis. 
Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that older age and 
antiplatelet agent use were independently associated with POD.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

(#)Contributed equally","Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is frequently and highly expressed in 
various human malignancies and protects cancer cells against apoptosis induced 
by multifarious stresses, particularly endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). 
The inhibition of GRP78 expression or activity could enhance apoptosis induced 
by anti-tumor drugs or compounds. Herein, we will evaluate the efficacy of 
lysionotin in the treatment of human liver cancer as well as the molecular 
mechanism. Moreover, we will examine whether inhibition of GRP78 enhanced the 
sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to lysionotin. We found that 
lysionotin significantly suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of liver 
cancer cells. TEM showed that lysionotin-treated liver cancer cells showed an 
extensively distended and dilated endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Meanwhile, the 
levels of the ER stress hallmark GRP78 and UPR hallmarks (e.g., IRE1α and CHOP) 
were significantly increased in response to lysionotin treatment in liver cancer 
cells. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger NAC and caspase-3 
inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO visibly attenuated the induction of GRP78 and attenuated 
the decrease in cell viability induced by lysionotin. More importantly, the 
knockdown of GRP78 expression by siRNAs or treatment with EGCG, both induced 
remarkable increase in lysionotin-induced PARP and pro-caspase-3 cleavage and 
JNK phosphorylation. In addition, knockdown of GRP78 expression by siRNA or 
suppression GRP78 activity by EGCG both significantly improved the effectiveness 
of lysionotin. These data indicated that pro-survival GRP78 induction may 
contribute to lysionotin resistance. The combination of EGCG and lysionotin is 
suggested to represent a novel approach in cancer chemo-prevention and 
therapeutics.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Cell Stress Society

including tumorigenicity, immortality, and chemoresistance. Colorectal CSCs have 
been identified and isolated from colorectal cancers by various methods. AKAP12, 
a scaffolding protein, is considered to act as a potential suppressor in 
colorectal cancer, but its role in CSCs remains unknown. In this study, we 
investigated the function of AKAP12 in Colorectal CSCs.
METHODS: Herein, Colorectal CSCs were enriched by cell culture with a serum-free 
medium. CSC-associated characteristics were evaluated by Flow cytometry assay 
and qPCR. AKAP12 gene expression was regulated by lentiviral transfection assay. 
The tumorigenicity of AKAP12 in vivo by constructing a tumor xenograft model. 
The related pathways were explored by qPCR and Western blot.
RESULTS: The depletion of AKAP12 reduced colony formation, sphere formation, and 
expression of stem cell markers in colorectal cancer cells, while its knockdown 
decreased the volume and weight of tumor xenografts in vivo. AKAP12 expression 
levels also affected the expression of stemness markers associated with STAT3, 
potentially via regulating the expression of protein kinase C.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests Colorectal CSCs overexpress AKAP12 and maintain 
stem cell characteristics through the AKAP12/PKC/STAT3 pathway. AKAP12 may be an 
important therapeutic target for blocking the development of colorectal cancer 
in the field of cancer stem cells.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Federación de Sociedades

treatment for breast cancer with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) until 
2011, when data from the Z11 and AMAROS trials challenged its survival benefit 
in early stage breast cancer. We assessed the contribution of patient, tumor, 
and facility factors on cALND use in patients undergoing mastectomy and SLN 
biopsy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, patients diagnosed 
from 2012 to 2017 who underwent upfront mastectomy and SLN biopsy with at least 
one positive SLN were included. A multivariable mixed effects logistic 
regression model was used to determine the effect of patient, tumor, and 
facility variables on cALND use. Reference effect measures (REM) were used to 
compare the contribution of general contextual effects (GCE) to variation in 
cALND use.
RESULTS: From 2012 to 2017, the overall use of cALND decreased from 81.3% to 
68.0%. Overall, younger patients, larger tumors, higher grade tumors, and tumors 
with lymphovascular invasion were more likely to undergo cALND. Facility 
variables, including higher surgical volume and facility location in the 
Midwest, were associated with increased use of cALND. However, REM results 
showed that the contribution of GCE to the variation in cALND use exceeded that 
of the measured patient, tumor, facility, and time variables.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease in cALND use during the study period. However, 
cALND was frequently performed in women after mastectomy found to have a 
positive SLN. There is high variability in cALND use, mainly driven by 
interfacility practice variation rather than specific high-risk patient and/or 
tumor characteristics.",© 2023. Society of Surgical Oncology.,"DOI: 10.1245/s10434-023-13698-8

the 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI-5) for postoperative mortality, 
delirium and pneumonia in patients over 65 years of age undergoing elective lung 
cancer surgery.
METHODS: Data were collected from a single-center retrospective cohort study 
conducted in a general tertiary hospital from January 2017 to August 2019. In 
total, the study included 1372 elderly patients aged over 65 who underwent 
elective lung cancer surgery. They were divided into frail group (mFI-5, 2-5), 
prefrail group (mFI-5, 1) and robust group (mFI-5, 0) on the basis of mFI-5 
classification. The primary outcome was postoperative 1-year all-cause 
mortality. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pneumonia and postoperative 
delirium.
RESULTS: Frailty group had the highest incidence of postoperative delirium 
(frailty 31.2% versus prefrailty 1.6% versus robust 1.5%, p < 0.001), 
postoperative pneumonia (frailty 23.5% versus prefrailty 7.2% versus robust 
7.7%, p < 0.001), and postoperative 1-year mortality (frailty 7.0% versus 
prefrailty 2.2% versus robust 1.9%. p < 0.001). Frail patients have 
significantly longer length of hospitalization than those in the robust group 
and prefrail patients (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a clear link 
between frailty and increased risk of postoperative delirium (aOR 2.775, 95% CI

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Serine metabolism is frequently dysregulated in many types of cancers 
and the tumor suppressor p53 is recently emerging as a key regulator of serine 
metabolism. However, the detailed mechanism remains unknown. Here, we 
investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of how p53 regulates the serine 
synthesis pathway (SSP) in bladder cancer (BLCA).
METHODS: Two BLCA cell lines RT-4 (WT p53) and RT-112 (p53 R248Q) were 
manipulated by applying CRISPR/Cas9 to examine metabolic differences under WT 
and mutant p53 status. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
and non-targeted metabolomics analysis were adopted to identify metabolomes 
changes between WT and p53 mutant BLCA cells. Bioinformatics analysis using the 
cancer genome atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus datasets and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was used to investigate PHGDH expression. 
Loss-of-function of PHGDH and subcutaneous xenograft model was adopted to 
investigate the function of PHGDH in mice BLCA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
(Ch-IP) assay was performed to analyze the relationships between YY1, p53, SIRT1 
and PHGDH expression.
RESULTS: SSP is one of the most prominent dysregulated metabolic pathways by 
comparing the metabolomes changes between wild-type (WT) p53 and mutant p53 of 
BLCA cells. TP53 gene mutation shows a positive correlation with PHGDH 
expression in TCGA-BLCA database. PHGDH depletion disturbs the reactive oxygen 
species homeostasis and attenuates the xenograft growth in the mouse model. 
Further, we demonstrate WT p53 inhibits PHGDH expression by recruiting SIRT1 to 
the PHGDH promoter. Interestingly, the DNA binding motifs of YY1 and p53 in the 
PHGDH promoter are partially overlapped which causes competition between the two 
transcription factors. This competitive regulation of PHGDH is functionally 
linked to the xenograft growth in mice.
CONCLUSION: YY1 drives PHGDH expression in the context of mutant p53 and

health care services among adults with Medicaid coverage who have a high school 
or less than high school degree. The analysis spans the large changes in 
Medicaid fees that occurred before and after the ACA-mandated fee increase for 
primary care services in 2013-2014. We use data from the Behavioral Risk Factors 
Surveillance System and a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the 
association between Medicaid fees and whether a person has a personal doctor; a 
routine check-up or flu shot in the past year; whether a woman had a pap test or 
a mammogram in the past year; whether a person has ever been diagnosed with 
asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, COPD, arthritis, depression, 
or kidney diseases; and, whether a person reports good-to-excellent health. 
Estimates indicate that Medicaid fee increases were associated with small 
increases in the likelihood of having a personal doctor, or receiving a flu 
shot, although only having a personal doctor remained significant when 
accounting for multiple hypothesis testing. We conclude that Medicaid fees did 
not have a major impact on the use of primary care or on the consequences of 
that care.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

increase risk of complications such as immobilization and reduce hospital 
capacity. Continuous monitoring detects more deviating vital signs than 
intermittent measurements and may help identify patients at risk of 
deterioration after discharge. We aimed to investigate the association between 
deviating vital signs detected by continuous monitoring prior to discharge and 
risk of readmission within 30 days. Patients undergoing elective major abdominal 
surgery or admitted with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease were included in this study. Eligible patients had vital signs monitored 
continuously within the last 24 h prior to discharge. The association between 
sustained deviated vital signs and readmission risk was analyzed by using 
Mann-Whitney's U test and Chi-square test. A total of 51 out of 265 patients 
(19%) were readmitted within 30 days. Deviated respiratory vital signs occurred 
frequently in both groups: desaturation < 88% for at least ten minutes was seen 
in 66% of patients who were readmitted and in 62% of those who were not 
(p = 0.62) while desaturation < 85% for at least five minutes was seen in 58% of 
readmitted and 52% of non-readmitted patients (p = 0.5). At least one sustained 
deviated vital sign was detected in 90% and 85% of readmitted patients and

quantification of so-called radiomic features from medical images. The growing 
importance of radiomics applied to oncology in improving diagnosis, cancer 
staging and grading, and improved personalized treatment, has been well 
established; yet, this new analysis technique has still few applications in 
cardiovascular imaging. Several studies have shown promising results describing 
how radiomics principles could improve the diagnostic accuracy of coronary 
computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 
diagnosis, risk stratification, and follow-up of patients with coronary heart 
disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 
hypertensive heart disease (HHD), and many other cardiovascular diseases. Such 
quantitative approach could be useful to overcome the main limitations of CCTA 
and MRI in the evaluation of cardiovascular diseases, such as readers' 
subjectiveness and lack of repeatability. Moreover, this new discipline could 
potentially overcome some technical problems, namely the need of contrast 
administration or invasive examinations. Despite such advantages, radiomics is 
still not applied in clinical routine, due to lack of standardized parameters 
acquisition, inconsistent radiomic methods, lack of external validation, and 
different knowledge and experience among the readers. The purpose of this 
manuscript is to provide a recent update on the status of radiomics clinical 
applications in cardiovascular imaging.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s11547-023-01658-x

cross-disciplinary collaboration in cancer prevention and control, we sought to 
explore the historical and contemporary evolution of health equity and

from data that were analyzed and interpreted using a constructivist, reflexive, 
thematic analysis approach. Nearly all participants reported a strong focus on 
studying health disparities since the inception of the CPCRN, which offered the 
network a distinct advantage in recent years for incorporating an intentional 
focus on health equity. Recent law enforcement injustices and the inequities 
observed during the COVID-19 pandemic have further invigorated network 
activities around health equity, such as development of a health equity-focused 
workgroup toolkit, among other cross-center activities. Several participants 
noted that, in terms of deep, meaningful, and impactful health equity-oriented 
research, there are still great strides for the network to make, while also 
acknowledging CPCRN as well-aligned with the national dialogue led by federal 
agency partners around health equity. Finally, several future directions were 
mentioned by the participants, including a focus on supporting a diverse

adjuvant hormone therapy and mortality among older women with breast cancer.
METHODS: The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results data linked with U.S. 
Medicare claims was used. This study included older women diagnosed with stage 
I-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer from 2009 through 2017. Adherence 
was defined as having proportion of days covered (PDC) ≥ 0.80. Persistence was 
defined as having no discontinuation, i.e., no break of ≥ 180 continuous days. 
Length of persistence was calculated as time from therapy initiation to 
discontinuation. Cox models with time-dependent covariates were used to assess 
associations between adherence and persistence with mortality.
RESULTS: This study included 25,796 women. Adherence rates were 78.1 percent, 
75.2 percent, 72.4 percent, 70.0 percent, and 61.5 percent from year 1 to year 5 
after hormone therapy initiation. Persistence rates were 87.5 percent, 81.7 
percent, 77.1 percent, 72.9 percent, and 68.9 percent through cumulative 
intervals of 1 year up to 5 years. Adherence was associated with all-cause 
mortality but not associated with breast cancer-specific mortality. Persistent 
women had lower risk of all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific 
mortality. Each additional year of persistence had additional contributions to 
survival benefits (11% decreased risk of all-cause mortality and 37% decreased 
risk of breast cancer-specific mortality).
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the detrimental effect of nonadherence to 
adjuvant hormone therapy across up to 5 years on all-cause survival in older 
U.S. women. It also reveals the survival benefits associated with having longer 
persistence across up to 5 years.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(ET) on the risk and site of recurrence among older women with early stage, 
hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer (EBC).
METHODS: A population-based cohort of women age ≥ 65 years with T1N0 HR + EBC 
who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 and treated with breast-conserving 
surgery (BCS) + ET was identified. Treatment and outcomes were ascertained 
through linkage with administrative databases. ET non-adherence was examined as 
a time-dependent covariate in multivariable cause-specific Cox regression models 
to evaluate its effect on the risks of ipsilateral local recurrence (LR), 
contralateral breast cancer, and distant metastases.
RESULTS: The population cohort includes 2637 women; 73% (N = 1934) received 
radiation (RT) + ET and 27% (N = 703) received ET alone. At a median follow-up 
of 8.14 years, the first event was LR in 3.6% of women treated with ET alone and 
1.4% for those treated with RT + ET (p < 0.001); the risk of distant metastases 
was < 1% in both groups. The proportion of time adherent to ET was 69.0% among 
those treated with RT + ET and 62.8% for those treated with ET alone. On 
multivariable analysis, increasing proportion of time non-adherent to ET was 
associated with increased risk of LR ((HR = 1.52 per 20% increase in time; 95%CI 
1.25, 1.85; p < 0.001), contralateral BC (HR = 1.55; 95%CI 1.30, 1.84; 
p < 0.001), and distant metastases (HR = 1.44; 95%CI 1.08, 1.94; p = 0.01) but 
absolute risks were low.
CONCLUSION: Non-adherence to adjuvant ET was associated with an increased risk 
of recurrence, but absolute recurrence rates were low.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

use on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in hormone receptor-positive 
breast cancer (BC) survivors report conflicting results. We examined 
associations of endocrine therapy use with incident diabetes, dyslipidemia, and 
hypertension.
METHODS: The Pathways Heart Study examines cancer treatment exposures with 
CVD-related outcomes in Kaiser Permanente Northern California members with BC. 
Electronic health records provided sociodemographic and health characteristics, 
BC treatment, and CVD risk factor data. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) of incident diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension in hormone 
receptor-positive BC survivors using AIs or tamoxifen compared with survivors 
not using endocrine therapy were estimated using Cox proportional hazards 
regression models adjusted for known confounders.
RESULTS: In 8985 BC survivors, mean baseline age and follow-up time was 63.3 and 
7.8 years, respectively; 83.6% were postmenopausal. By treatment, 77.0% used 
AIs, 19.6% used tamoxifen, and 16.0% used neither. Postmenopausal women who used 
tamoxifen had an increased rate (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.06-1.92) of developing 
hypertension relative to those who did not use endocrine therapy. Tamoxifen use 
was not associated with incident diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension in 
premenopausal BC survivors. Postmenopausal AI users had higher hazard rates of 
developing diabetes (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05-1.80), dyslipidemia (HR 1.58, 95% CI 
1.29-1.92), and hypertension (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.24-1.82) compared with 
non-endocrine therapy users.
CONCLUSION: Hormone receptor-positive BC survivors treated with AIs may have 
higher rates of developing diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension over an 
average 7.8 years post-diagnosis.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(#)Contributed equally","Proline and serine-rich coiled-coil 1 (PSRC1) has been reported to function as 
an oncogene in several cancers by regulating mitosis, while there are few 
reports on the role of PSRC1 in lower-grade glioma (LGG). Thus, this study 
collected 22 samples and 1126 samples from our institution and several 
databases, respectively, to explore the function of PSRC1 in LGG. First, the 
analysis of clinical characteristics showed that PSRC1 was always highly 
expressed in more malignant clinical characteristics of LGG, such as higher WHO 
grade, recurrence type, and IDH wild type. Second, the prognosis analysis 
revealed that the high expression of PSRC1 was an independent risk factor 
contributing to the shorter overall survival of LGG patients. Third, the 
analysis of DNA methylation showed that the expression of PSRC1 was associated 
with its 8 DNA methylation sites, overall negatively regulated by its DNA 
methylation level in LGG. Fourth, the analysis of immune correlation revealed 
that the expression of PSRC1 was positively correlated with the infiltration of 
6 immune cells and the expression of 4 well-known immune checkpoints in LGG, 
respectively. Finally, co-expression analysis and KEGG analysis showed the 10 
genes most related to PSRC1 and the signaling pathways involved by PSRC1 in LGG, 
respectively, such as MAPK signaling pathway and focal adhesion. In conclusion, 
this study identified the pathogenic role of PSRC1 in the pathological 
progression of LGG, expanding the molecular understanding of PSRC1, and provided 
a biomarker and potential immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of LGG.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

validated self-report questionnaires at baseline, immediately after the final 
session, and at three, six, and 12 months follow-up. A repeated measures 
mixed-effect model examined the effects of the program on depression, mental 
well-being, and masculinity. Seven focus groups (n = 37) and 39 semi-structured 
individual interviews explored participant reactions at follow-up.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine (93%) participants completed the questionnaires at all 
follow-ups. Responses indicated improved mental well-being up to three months 
(p < 0.01) and a decrease in depressive symptoms to 12 months (p < 0.05). 
Qualitative analysis revealed how the cohesive group environment alleviated 
psychological stress, enabled participants to identify significant issues and 
concerns in their lives, and improved communication and relationship skills that 
were of value in the group as well as with family and friends. The facilitation 
was essential to guiding participants to 'speak the unspeakable.'
CONCLUSION: Men with PC who speak of their experience in a group setting with a 
guided process incorporating features of a life review appear to gain insight 
into the impact of PC in their lives, experience diminished features of 
depression and isolation, and enhance their communication skills within the 
groups as well as with family members and friends.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: Our previous studies showed that naringin (Nar) can effectively 
reverse the cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells. This study aims to 
explore the potential mechanism by which Nar reverses cisplatin resistance in 
ovarian cancer.
METHODS: The proliferative activity of cells was evaluated using CCK8 and cell 
clone formation assays. Autophagic flux in cells was evaluated via LC3B 
immunofluorescence and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. The expression 
levels of autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis-related 
proteins were detected via Western blotting. Autophagy and ER stress were 
regulated using siATG5, siLC3B, rapamycin (Rap), chloroquine (CQ), 
4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), and thapsigargin (TG). siATG5 and siLC3B are short 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) used to knock down the expression of ATG5 and LC3B 
genes, respectively.
RESULTS: Nar inhibited autophagy in SKOV3/DDP cells by activating the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. And Nar increased the levels of ER stress-related 
proteins, namely, P-PERK, GRP78, and CHOP, and promoted apoptosis in SKOV3/DDP 
cells. Moreover, treatment with the inhibitor of ER stress alleviated apoptosis 
induced by Nar in SKOV3/DDP cells. In addition, compared to cisplatin or 
naringin alone, the combination of Nar and cisplatin significantly reduced the 
proliferative activity of SKOV3/DDP cells. And siATG5, siLC3B, CQ or TG 
pretreatment further inhibited the proliferative activity of SKOV3/DDP cells. 
Conversely, Rap or 4-PBA pretreatment alleviated the cell proliferation 
inhibition caused by Nar combined with cisplatin.
CONCLUSION: Nar not only inhibited the autophagy in SKOV3/DDP cells by 
regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, but also promoted apoptosis in 
SKOV3/DDP cells by targeting ER stress. Nar can reverse the cisplatin resistance 
in SKOV3/DDP cells through these two mechanisms.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s11033-023-08558-3

sorafenib is a first-line drug for the treatment of advanced liver cancer. 
Resistance to sorafenib has become a major challenge in the treatment of 
hepatocellular carcinoma, however, studies have shown that metformin can promote 
ferroptosis and sorafenib sensitivity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
investigate the promotion of ferroptosis and sorafenib sensitivity by metformin 
via ATF4/STAT3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
METHODS: Hepatocellular carcinoma cells Huh7 and Hep3B and induced sorafenib 
resistance (SR) Huh7/SR and Hep3B/SR cells were used as in vitro cell models. 
Cells were injected subcutaneously to establish a drug-resistant mouse model. 
CCK-8 was used to detect cell viability and sorafenib IC50. Western blotting was 
used to detect the expression of relevant proteins. BODIPY staining was used to 
analyze the lipid peroxidation level in cells. A scratch assay was used to 
detect cell migration. Transwell assays were used to detect cell invasion. 
Immunofluorescence was used to localize the expression of ATF4 and STAT3.
RESULTS: Metformin promoted ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells 
through ATF4/STAT3, decreased sorafenib IC50, increased ROS and lipid 
peroxidation levels, decreased cell migration and invasion, inhibited the 
expression of the drug-resistant proteins ABCG2 and P-GP in hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells, and thus inhibited sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells. Downregulating ATF4 inhibited the phosphorylated nuclear 
translocation of STAT3, promoted ferroptosis, and increased the sensitivity of 
Huh7 cells to sorafenib. Metformin was also shown in animal models to promote 
ferroptosis and sorafenib sensitivity in vivo via ATF4/STAT3.
CONCLUSION: Metformin promotes ferroptosis and sensitivity to sorafenib in 
hepatocellular carcinoma cells via ATF4/STAT3, and it inhibits HCC progression.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s11033-023-08492-4

challenges due to the drug resistance and drug toxicity for normal tissues. 
Herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) belongs to the naturally occurring aromatic 
phytochemicals and coumarins. Considering the boosting effect of nanocarriers in 
drug delivery, we investigated the proapoptotic, anti-metastatic properties, and 
molecular mechanism of herniarin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles on human 
gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS), human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), human 
pancreatic carcinoma (Panc-1), and normal human skin fibroblast (HFF) cell 
lines.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of synthesized nanoparticle have been 
tested using MTT assay. The obtained results manifested that concentration of 
herniarin that exerts 50% cell growth inhibition (IC50) against HT-29, AGS, and 
Panc-1 was calculated 138.34, 123.46, and 83.744 µL, respectively. Given that 
nanoparticles showed lowest IC50 values on Panc-1 cell line, these cells were 
selected for further analysis. The apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest 
were examined performing real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and DAPI/acridine 
orange-propidium iodide staining. The expression of apoptosis-related genes, 
including BCL-2, was decreased, while the expression of CASP9, CASP8, and CASP3 
was increased in response to the treatment. Moreover, the expression of 
metastasis-related gene (MMP2) was significantly suppressed under Her-SLN-NPs 
treatment. According to the flow cytometry findings, we observed no cell cycle 
arrest at any stage.
CONCLUSION: Our funding manifested herniarin encapsulated solid lipid 
nanoparticles has potent therapeutic target against Panc-1 cell line.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s11033-023-08560-9

groundwater as well as potential health risks in Kota district, Rajasthan, 
India. Total 198 groundwater samples were collected in both dry and wet periods 
and analyzed for physicochemical parameters along with U, F-, and NO3- using 
standard methods. Results indicate that the electrical conductivity, total 
dissolved solids, total hardness, alkalinity, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, NO3-, and 
F- exceed the WHO standard limits of drinking water in both periods. Uranium 
concentration is at the broader of drinking water permissible limit (30 μg/L) 
and found about 1.05 times more. Nitrate and fluoride concentrations ranged from 
9.8 to 412.0 mg/L and 0.1 to 4.0 mg/L for the dry season, while in the wet 
period, they varied from 10.0 to 954.0 mg/L and 0.1 to 3.5 mg/L, respectively. 
Correlation studies show a significantly strong positive correlation between 
uranium and total alkalinity and carbonate. Natural background levels (NBLs) 
were explored to assess the source of groundwater pollution. It shows that the 
second inflection points of NBLs estimated for NO3-, F-, and U are about 
168 mg/L, 1.2 mg/L, and 7.3 μg/L, respectively, during the experimental period. 
The USEPA technique was used to evaluate the non-carcinogenic health risks 
associated with consuming the NO3- and F--contaminated groundwater. The health 
risks in Kota district show that children are more at risk than adults. The risk 
assessment of uranium reveals that the excess cancer risk (ECR) and hazard 
quotient (HQ) are found to be below the standard limits, but a high 
concentration of uranium (31.6 μg/L) is observed at Amarpura village of Digod 
block. This study will provide a baseline of uranium, fluoride, and nitrate

complete the entire metastatic cascade: invasion, intravasation, survival in the

propose that cells engaging a Polyaneuploid Cancer Cell (PACC) phenotype are 
metastasis competent. Cells in the PACC state are enlarged, endocycling (i.e.

cells have increased motility. Additionally, cells in the PACC state exhibit 
increased capacity for environment-sensing and directional migration in 
chemotactic environments, predicting successful invasion. Magnetic Twisting

display hyper-elastic properties like increased peripheral deformability and

However, some patients still cannot get benefit from the therapy, because

adjunctive therapy is urgently needed to suppress metastasis of 
cetuximab-treated CRC cells. In this study, we used two KRAS wild-type CRC

saponin isolated from Chinese medicinal herb Platycodon grandifloras, is able to 
suppress the metastasis of cetuximab-treated CRC. Label-free quantitative 
proteomics analyses showed that platycodin D but not cetuximab significantly 
inhibited expression of β-catenin in both CRC cells, and suggested that 
platycodin D counteracted the inhibition effect of cetuximab on cell adherence 
and functioned in repressing cell migration and invasion. Western blot results 
showed that single platycodin D treatment or combined platycodin D and cetuximab 
enhanced inhibition effects on expressions of key genes in Wnt/β-catenin

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: As an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10 (IL-10) plays a 
vital role in preventing inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies while also 
maintaining immune homeostasis. IL-10 production in macrophages is tightly 
regulated by multiple pathways. TRIM24, a member of the Transcriptional 
Intermediary Factor 1 (TIF1) family, contributes to antiviral immunity and 
macrophage M2 polarization. However, the role of TRIM24 in regulating IL-10 
expression and its involvement in endotoxic shock remains unclear.
METHODS: In vitro, bone marrow derived macrophages cultured with GM-CSF or M-CSF 
were stimulated with LPS (100ng/ml). Murine models of endotoxic shock were 
established by challenging the mice with different dose of LPS (i.p). RTPCR, RNA 
sequencing, ELISA and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to elucidate 
the role and mechanisms of TRIM24 in endotoxic shock.
RESULTS: The expression of TRIM24 is downregulated in LPS-stimulated bone 
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Loss of TRIM24 boosted IL-10 expression 
during the late stage of LPS-stimulation in macrophages. RNA-seq analysis 
revealed the upregulation of IFNβ1, an upstream regulator of IL-10, in TRIM24 
knockout macrophages. Treatment with C646, a CBP/p300 inhibitor, diminished the 
difference in both IFNβ1 and IL-10 expression between TRIM24 knockout and 
control macrophages. Loss of TRIM24 provided protection against LPS-induced 
endotoxic shock in mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that inhibiting TRIM24 promoted the 
expression of IFNβ1 and IL-10 during macrophage activation, therefore protecting 
mice from endotoxic shock. This study offers novel insights into the regulatory 
role of TRIM24 in IL-10 expression, making it a potentially attractive 
therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

patients with serious illness. Despite experiencing significant treatment side 
effects, specialty palliative care is under-utilized by patients with advanced 
ovarian cancer. We explored barriers to palliative care in this population.
METHODS: We conducted a sequential mixed-methods study. Qualitative: we 
interviewed patients with advanced ovarian cancer (N = 7). Guided by the Social 
Ecological Model (SEM), interviews assessed intrapersonal, interpersonal, 
organizational, and policy-level barriers to receipt of specialty palliative 
care. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with directed 
content analysis. Quantitative: patients with advanced ovarian cancer (N = 38) 
completed self-report surveys assessing knowledge about, attitudes towards, and 
prior experiences with specialty palliative care. Descriptive statistics were 
used to characterize survey responses.
RESULTS: Qualitative analysis identified barriers to specialty palliative care 
at each SEM level. Intrapersonal factors (e.g., knowledge, attitudes) were most 
frequently discussed. Other common barriers included insurance coverage and 
distance/travel time. Survey responses indicated most participants were aware of 
palliative care (74%) but had mixed attitudes towards palliative care and did 
not feel they needed for palliative care. No survey respondents had received a 
physician recommendation for palliative care, and a sizable minority (29%) 
thought palliative care referral should only take place when patients have no 
remaining treatment options.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with advanced ovarian cancer, barriers to specialty 
palliative care exist at multiple levels. Our results underscore the potential 
value of a multilevel intervention to support receipt of palliative care in this 
population.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

falling incidence observed internationally. Organ preservation therapies have 
revolutionised management, though some patients may be unsuitable and survival 
was noted to fall in the 2000s. This study examines trends in laryngeal cancer 
in Ireland.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of National Cancer Registry of Ireland 
data from 1994 to 2014.
RESULTS: From a cohort of 2651, glottic disease was most common (62%, n = 1646). 
Incidence rose to 3.43 cases/100,000/year for 2010-2014. 5-year disease-specific 
survival (DSS) was 60.6% and did not change significantly over time. Overall 
survival (OS) for T3 disease managed with primary radiotherapy was similar to 
primary surgery (HR 0.98, p = 0.9). DSS for T3 disease improved with primary 
radiotherapy (HR 0.72, p = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: Incidence of laryngeal cancer in Ireland rose despite international 
trends, while survival changed little. Radiotherapy improves DSS for T3 disease 
but does not improve OS, possibly secondary to poor organ function 
post-radiotherapy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00405-023-08055-0

Radical Prostatectomy (RP; either Robot-Assisted [RARP] or Open RP [ORP]) in 
oligometastatic prostate cancer (omPCa). Additionally, we assessed whether there 
was an added benefit of metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) in these patients in 
the adjuvant setting.
METHODS: Overall, 68 patients with omPCa (≤ 5 skeletal lesions at conventional 
imaging) treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection between 2006 and 2022 
were included. Additional therapies (androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] and MDT) 
were administered according to the treating physicians' judgment. MDT was 
defined as metastasis surgery/radiotherapy within 6 months of RP. We assessed 
Clinical Progression (CP), Biochemical Recurrence (BCR), post-operative 
complications and overall mortality (OM) of RP and the impact of adjuvant 
MDT + ADT versus RP + ADT alone.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 73 months (IQR 62-89). RARP reduced the risk of 
severe complications after adjusting for age and CCI (OR 0.15; p = 0.02). After 
RP, 68% patients were continent. Median 90-days PSA after RP was 0.12 ng/dL. CP 
and OM-free survival at 7 years were 50% and 79%, respectively. The 7-years 
OM-free survival rates were 93 vs. 75% for men treated with vs. without MDT 
(p = 0.04). At regression analyses, MDT after surgery was associated with a 70% 
decreased mortality rate (HR 0.27, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: RP appeared to represent a safe and feasible option in omPCa. RARP 
reduced the risk of severe complications. Integrating MDT with surgery in the 
context of a multimodal treatment might improve survival in selected omPCa 
patients.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

aims to reduce side effects. However, it remains difficult to select eligible 
candidates. We herein examined eligibility factors for hemi-ablative FT for 
prostate cancer.
METHODS: We identified 412 patients who were diagnosed with unilateral prostate 
cancer by biopsy and had undergone radical prostatectomy between 2009 and 2018. 
Among these patients, 111 underwent MRI before biopsy, had 10-20 core biopsies 
performed, and did not receive other treatments before surgery. Fifty-seven 
patients with prostate-specific antigen ≥ 15 ng/mL and biopsy Gleason score 
(GS) ≥ 4 + 3 were excluded. The remaining 54 patients were evaluated. Both lobes 
of the prostate were scored using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 
version 2 on MRI. Ineligible patients for FT were defined as those with ≥ 0.5 mL 
GS6 or GS ≥ 3 + 4 in the biopsy-negative lobe, ≥ pT3, or lymph node involvement. 
Selected predictors of eligibility for hemi-ablative FT were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among our cohort of 54 patients, 29 (53.7%) were eligible for 
hemi-ablative FT. A multivariate analysis identified a PI-RADS score < 3 in the 
biopsy-negative lobe (p = 0.016) as an independent predictor of eligibility for 
FT. Thirteen out of 25 ineligible patients had GS ≥ 3 + 4 tumors in the 
biopsy-negative lobe, half of whom (6/13) also had a PI-RADS score < 3 in the 
biopsy-negative lobe.
CONCLUSION: The PI-RADS score in the biopsy-negative lobe may be important in 
the selection of eligible candidates for FT. The findings of this study will 
help reduce missed significant prostate cancers and improve FT outcomes.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

zone. The aim of this study is to analyze the differences between the prevalence 
and grade of malignancy of mpMRI-targeted biopsies that involve the TZ with 
respect to the PZ.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 597 men evaluated for PC screening between 
February 2016 and October 2022 was conducted. Exclusion criteria were prior BPH 
surgery, radiotherapy, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors treatment, UTI, mixed 
involvement of PZ-TZ or doubts, and central-zone involvement. Hypothesis 
contrast test was used to study differences proportions of malignancy (ISUP > 0) 
and significant (ISUP > 1) and high-grade tumor (ISUP > 3) in 
PI-RADSv2 > 2-targeted biopsies in PZ with respect to TZ, and logistic 
regression and hypothesis contrast tests were used to study the influence of the 
area of exposure as an effect-modifying factor in the diagnosis of malignancy 
with respect to the PI-RADSv2 classification.
RESULTS: 473 patients were selected and 573 lesions biopsied (127 PI-RADS3, 346 
PI-RADS4 and 100 PI-RADS5). A significant increase was described in the 
proportion of malignancy and significant and high-grade tumor in PZ compared to 
TZ (22.6%, 21.3%, and 8.7%, respectively). Significant increase in proportions 
and malignancy were described in cores targeted to PZ with respect to TZ, 
highlight the differences between PZ and TZ for ST (37.3%vs23.7% for PI-RADS4, 
69.2%vs27.3% for PI-RADS5, respectively). Statistically significant linear trend 
was described increasing for malignancy, significant and high-grade tumors with 
respect to the PI-RADSv2 scores (change > 10%).
CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence and grade of malignancy in the TZ is lower 
than in the PZ, PI-RADS4 and 5-targeted biopsies should not be omitted in this 
location, but PI-RADS3 could be.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

baseline level of Total Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) after endoscopic 
enucleation of the prostate with Holmium Laser (HoLEP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of a prospectively collected database 
of adult males undergoing HoLEP at a single tertiary institution from September 
2015 to February 2021. Pre-operative epidemiological, clinical characteristics 
and post-operative factors were analyzed and a multivariate analysis was 
performed to determine factors independently related to PSA decline.
RESULTS: A total of 175 men aged 49-92 years with a prostate size ranging from 
25 to 450 cc underwent HoLEP, and after excluding data from patients due to loss 
of follow-up or incomplete data, 126 patients were included in the final 
analysis. The patients were divided into group A (n = 84), which included 
patients with postoperative PSA nadir lower than 1 ng/ml, and group B(n = 42), 
with postoperative PSA levels greater than 1 ng/ml. In the univariate analysis 
there was a correlation between the variation of the PSA value and the 
percentage of resected tissue (p = 0.028), for each 1 g of resected prostate 
there was a reduction of 0.104 ng/mL, furthermore there was a difference between 
the means of age of group A (71.56 years) and group B (68.17 years) (p = 0.042). 
In the multivariate analysis, the use of statins and lower postoperative PSA 
levels (p = 0.024; HR = 3.71) were correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PSA after HoLEP is correlated with 
patient's age, the presence of incidental prostate cancer, and the use of 
statins.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

common complaint among breast cancer patients: bone pain. Classically, this type 
of pain is treated using escalating doses of opioids, which lack long-term 
efficacy due to analgesic tolerance, opioid-induced hypersensitivity, and have 
recently been linked to enhanced bone loss. To date, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying these adverse effects have not been fully explored. Using an 
immunocompetent murine model of metastatic breast cancer, we demonstrated that 
sustained morphine infusion induced a significant increase in osteolysis and 
hypersensitivity within the ipsilateral femur through the activation of 
toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). Pharmacological blockade with TAK242 (resatorvid) 
as well as the use of a TLR4 genetic knockout ameliorated the chronic 
morphine-induced osteolysis and hypersensitivity. Genetic MOR knockout did not 
mitigate chronic morphine hypersensitivity or bone loss. In vitro studies using 
RAW264.7 murine macrophages precursor cells demonstrated morphine-enhanced 
osteoclastogenesis that was inhibited by the TLR4 antagonist. Together, these 
data indicate that morphine induces osteolysis and hypersensitivity that are 
mediated, in part, through a TLR4 receptor mechanism.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on

inadequate, in large part, because the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying 
the development of chronic pain remain poorly understood. Pain biomarkers could 
potentially identify and measure biological pathways and phenotypical 
expressions that are altered by pain, provide insight into biological treatment 
targets, and help identify at-risk patients who might benefit from early 
intervention. Biomarkers are used to diagnose, track, and treat other diseases, 
but no validated clinical biomarkers exist yet for chronic pain. To address this 
problem, the National Institutes of Health Common Fund launched the Acute to 
Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) program to evaluate candidate biomarkers, 
develop them into biosignatures, and discover novel biomarkers for 
chronification of pain after surgery. This article discusses candidate 
biomarkers identified by A2CPS for evaluation, including genomic, proteomic, 
metabolomic, lipidomic, neuroimaging, psychophysical, psychological, and 
behavioral measures. Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures will provide the most 
comprehensive investigation of biomarkers for the transition to chronic 
postsurgical pain undertaken to date. Data and analytic resources generated by 
A2CPS will be shared with the scientific community in hopes that other 
investigators will extract valuable insights beyond A2CPS's initial findings. 
This article will review the identified biomarkers and rationale for including 
them, the current state of the science on biomarkers of the transition from 
acute to chronic pain, gaps in the literature, and how A2CPS will address these

influences treatment escalation or de-escalation in context of Hodgkin lymphomas 
or is, in case of lung cancer, able to reduce unnecessary surgeries. Hence,

associated sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, the vast majority of 
colorectal cancers arise in a tolerogenic microenvironment with mismatch-repair 
proficiency, low tumor-intrinsic immunogenicity, and negligible immunotherapy 
responsiveness. Treatment strategies to augment tumor immunity with combination 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy have broadly failed in 
mismatch-repair proficient tumors. Similarly, although several small single-arm 
studies have shown that checkpoint blockade plus radiation or select tyrosine 
kinase inhibition may show improved outcomes compared to historical controls, 
this finding has not been clearly validated in randomized trials. An evolving 
next generation of intelligently engineered checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific 
T-cell engagers, and emerging CAR-T cell therapies may improve immunorecognition 
of colorectal tumors. Across these modalities, ongoing translational efforts to 
better define patient populations and biomarkers associated with immune 
response, as well as combine biologically-sound and mutually-amplifying 
therapies show promise for a new era of immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.","DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-2176

thyroid nodule is consistent with the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer 
(MTC). In cases where the CT test have a slight to moderate increase, the 
calcium gluconate stimulation test is helpful to increase diagnostic accuracy. 
However, reliable cut-offs for calcium-stimulated Ct are still lacking. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the sex-specific calcium-stimulated Ct cutoffs for 
the diagnosis of MTC in a multicenter series. A comparison between different Ct 
assays has been also performed.
METHODS: 90 subjects undergone calcium-stimulated Ct for a suspected MTC in 5 
Endocrine Units between 2010-2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Serum Ct 
concentrations were assessed by immunoradiometric (IRMA) or chemiluminescence 
(CLIA) assays.
RESULTS: MTC was diagnosed in 37 (41.1%) and excluded in 53 (58.9%) patients. 
The best calcium-stimulated Ct cut-off to identify MTC was 611 pg/mL in males 
(AUC =0.90, 95% CI (0.76;1) and 445 pg/mL in females (AUC=0.79, 95% CI 
(0.66;0.91). Logistic regression analysis showed that both basal (OR 1.01, 
P=0.003) and peak Ct after stimulation (OR 1.07, P=0.007) were significantly 
associated with MTC, together with sex (OR=0.06, P<0.001). The ""Ct assay"" 
variable was also considered in the logistic regression model, but it was not 
significantly associated with MTC (OR=0.93, P=0.919).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that calcium test could be helpful to identify 
patients with early-stage MTC and those without MTC. A Ct value of 611 pg/mL in 
males and 445 pg/mL in females are proposed as the optimal Ct cut-offs at the 
stimulation test.","DOI: 10.23736/S2724-6507.23.04017-4

cancer in the globe, and it encompasses a wide range of tumors that affect the 
oral, facial and neck region. Despite breakthroughs in treatment strategies, 
patients survival has not increased substantially in the last few decades. 
Therefore, there is need for quick and reliable biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets for the treatment of HNC. Interestingly, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a small 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have a role in the post-transcriptional regulation 
of gene expression. Thus, the aim of the study is to evaluate the role of 
miR-7-3p in the HNC and normal tissues.
METHODS: A total of 25 HNC and normal tissues were collected from the Department 
of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals. 
Bioinformatic tool (TargetScan) was used to predict the target for miR-7-3p. The 
tissue samples were processed for Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and following 
that total RNA was extracted and analyzed for expression studies using RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: The bioinformatic analysis of the current study have revealed that 
STAT3 is a direct target for miR-7-3p. The histopathological examination showed 
damaged epithelial cells and keratin pool formation was observed in HNC tissue. 
Our results have also revealed that the miR-7-3p levels were significantly 
reduced and STAT3 levels were significantly higher in the HNC tissues when 
compared to the normal tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-7-3p can be used as a prognostic, diagnostic biomarker and 
therapeutic target for the treatment of HNC.","DOI: 10.23736/S2724-6329.23.04824-6

associated with the lowest health related quality of life (HRQoL) of all 
cancers. With nearly 88% of adults aged ≥55 years at diagnosis, age-associated 
physical losses, comorbidities, and social factors contribute to worsening 
HRQoL. This qualitative study assessed dyadic (patient-informal caregiver) 
perspectives on the factors contributing to HRQoL in MM survivors.
METHODS: We recruited 21 dyads from the UNC-Chapel Hill Lineberger Comprehensive 
Cancer between 11/2021 and 04/2022. Participants completed a single dyadic 
semistructured interview capturing broad perspectives on MM. We used ATLAS. ti v 
9 for project management and to facilitate data analysis using the Sort and 
Sift, Think and Shift approach (ResearchTalk, Inc.). This iterative approach 
allowed the exploration and identification of themes within and across 
transcripts.
RESULTS: The mean age at enrollment was 71 years (median: 71, range: 57-90) for 
patients and 68 years (median 67, range: 37-88) for caregivers. All dyads were 
racially concordant (11 Black/AA and 10 White). However, we aggregated the 
findings due to no consistent racial differences. Six themes related to (1) 
physical burden, (2) treatment challenges, (3) losses of independence, (4) 
caregiver burden, (5) patient and caregiver perseverance, and (6) adjustment to 
a new normal were identified. Dyads also experienced MM together, resulting in 
patients and caregivers experiencing changes in their ability to engage in 
physical and social activities, which further contributed to poor HRQoL. 
Patients' increased need for social support led to shifts in the caregiver 
roles, resulting in caregivers feeling burdened by their responsibilities. All 
dyads acknowledged the need for perseverance and adaptability to a new normal 
with MM.
CONCLUSION: The functional, psychosocial, and HRQoL of older patients with MM 
and their caregivers remain impacted ≥6 months after a new diagnosis

high metastatic potential. In rare cases, it can be associated with 
paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS), which result from an antitumor immunity against 
antigens produced by the tumor itself. Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) 
is a neurological autoimmune PNS characterized by an impairment of the 
neuromuscular junction, leading to proximal muscle weakness and fatigability. 
Although the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is a breakthrough 
in the management of many cancers, onset or worsen of immune diseases has been 
described. Thereby, in patients with previous neurological PNS like LEMS, the 
ICI therapy for cancer may aggravate neurological symptoms and lead to 
irreversible impairment. We report here 2 cases of patients with metastatic MCC 
associated with a LEMS at the diagnosis. Both successfully received ICI 
therapies (anti-PDL1 avelumab and anti-PD1 pembrolizumab) without worsening of 
LEMS and any major immune-related adverse effects. Their neurological condition 
improved and disappeared concomitantly with the efficacy of immunotherapy, and 
we did not observe relapse of both MCC and LEMS after treatment discontinuation. 
Finally, we performed a complete review of the literature, which confirmed that 
ICI treatment could be discussed for patients with paraneoplastic LEMS, and 
emphasized the need for multidisciplinary management.","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000480

Recent research has shown that lncRNAs can encode micropeptides that mediate 
their functions in tumors. Here, we revealed that the liver-specific putative 
lncRNA, AC115619, is expressed at low levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
and encodes a micropeptide, designated as AC115619-22aa. AC115619 played a 
crucial role in the regulation of tumor progression and was a prognostic 
indicator in HCC. The encoded micropeptide AC115619-22aa inhibited the 
progression of HCC by binding to WTAP and impeding the assembly of the 
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex, which regulates the 
expression of tumor-associated genes, such as SOCS2 and ATG14. AC115619 was 
co-transcribed with the adjacent upstream coding gene APOB, and hypoxia induced 
transcriptional repression of both APOB and AC115619 by controlling HIF1A/HDAC3 
and HNF4A signaling. In animal and patient-derived models, AC115619-22aa reduced 
global m6A levels and suppressed tumor growth. In conclusion, this study 
establishes AC115619 and its encoded micropeptide as potential prognostic 
markers and therapeutic targets for patients with HCC.","DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-0337

limited, and resistance to gemcitabine, a cornerstone of PDAC chemotherapy 
regimens, remains a major challenge. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent 
modification in mRNA that has been linked to diverse biological processes in 
human diseases. Herein, by characterizing the global m6A profile in a panel of 
gemcitabine-sensitive and gemcitabine-insensitive PDAC cells, we identified a 
key role for elevated m6A modification of the master G0/G1 regulator FZR1 in 
regulating gemcitabine sensitivity. Targeting FZR1 m6A modification augmented 
the response to gemcitabine treatment in gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells both 
in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, GEMIN5 was identified as a novel m6A 
mediator that specifically bound to m6A-modified FZR1 and recruited the eIF3 
translation initiation complex to accelerate FZR1 translation. FZR1 upregulation 
maintained the G0/G1 quiescent state and suppressed gemcitabine sensitivity in 
PDAC cells. Clinical analysis further demonstrated that both high levels of FZR1 
m6A modification and FZR1 protein corresponded to poor response to gemcitabine. 
These findings reveal the critical function of m6A modification in regulating 
gemcitabine sensitivity in PDAC and identify the FZR1/GEMIN5 axis as a potential 
target to enhance gemcitabine response.","DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-3346

Fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), is commonly used for 
treating estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients, but its broad 
and continual application is limited by poor solubility, invasive muscle 
administration, and drug resistance. Here, we developed an active targeting 
motif-modified, intravenously injectable, hydrophilic NP that encapsulates 
fulvestrant to facilitate its delivery via the bloodstream to tumors, improving 
bioavailability and systemic tolerability. Additionally, the NP was co-loaded 
with abemaciclib, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), to 
prevent the development of drug resistance associated with long-term fulvestrant 
treatment. Targeting peptide modifications on the NP surface assisted in the 
site-specific release of the drugs to ensure specific toxicity in the tumor 
tissues and spare normal tissue. The NP formulation (PPFA-cRGD) exhibited 
efficient tumor cell killing in both in vitro organoid models and in vivo

eligibility for liver transplantation (LT). Radiological-histopathological 
discordance may lead to improper staging and may impact patient outcomes. We 
aimed to assess the radiological-histopathological discordance at the time of LT 
in HCC patients and its impact on the post-LT outcomes.
METHODS: We analyzed further the effect of 6-month waiting policy on the 
discordance. Using United Network for Organ Sharing-Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network (UNOS-OPTN) database, we examined the discordance 
between pre-LT imaging and explant histopathology for all adult HCC patients who 
received liver transplants from deceased donors between April 2012 and December 
2017. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the 
impact of discordance on 3-year HCC recurrence and mortality.
RESULTS: Of 6842 patients included in the study, 66.7% were within Milan 
criteria on both imaging and explant histopathology, and 33.3% were within the 
Milan based on imaging but extended beyond Milan on explant histopathology. Male 
gender, increasing numbers of tumors, bilobar distribution, larger tumor size, 
and increasing AFP are associated with increased discordance. Post-LT HCC 
recurrence and death were significantly higher in patients who were discordant, 
with histopathology beyond Milan (adj HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.32-2.63 for mortality 
and 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.70 for recurrence). Graft allocation policy with 6-month 
waiting time led to increased discordance (OR 1.19, CI 1.01-1.41), although it 
did not impact post-LT outcome.
CONCLUSION: Current practice for staging of HCC based on radiological imaging 
features alone results in underestimation of HCC burden in one out of three 
patients with HCC. This discordance is associated with a higher risk of post-LT 
HCC recurrence and mortality. These patients will need enhanced surveillance to 
optimize patient selection and aggressive LRT to reduce post-LT recurrence and 
increase survival.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6161

and cost-effectiveness of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) before 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC).
METHODS: Eligible patients received pretreatment PEG and enteral nutrition 
during CCRT. The primary outcome was the change of weight during CCRT. The 
secondary outcome included nutrition status, loco-regional objective response 
rate (ORR), loco-regional progression-free survival (LRFS), overall survival 
(OS), and toxicities. A 3-state Markov model was applied for cost-effectiveness 
analysis. Eligible patients were matched and compared with those who had 
nasogastric tube feeding (NTF) or oral nutritional supplements (ONS).
RESULTS: Sixty-three eligible patients received pretreatment PEG-based CCRT. The 
mean change of weight during CCRT was -1.4% (standard deviation, 4.4%), and 
after CCRT, 28.6% of patients gained weight and 98.4% had normal albumin levels. 
The loco-regional ORR and 1-year LRFS were 98.4% and 88.3%. The incidence of 
grade ≥3 esophagitis was 14.3%. After matching, another 63 patients were 
included in the NTF group and 63 in the ONS group. More patients gained weight 
after CCRT in the PEG group (p = 0.001). The PEG group showed higher 
loco-regional ORR (p = 0.036) and longer 1-year LRFS (p = 0.030). In cost 
analysis, the PEG group showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$3457.65 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) compared with the ONS group with 
a probability of cost-effectiveness of 77.7% at the $10,000 per QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSION: Pretreatment PEG is associated with better nutritional status and 
treatment outcome in ESCC patients treated with CCRT compared with ONS and NTF. 
Pretreatment of PEG can be cost-effective because of its significant clinical 
benefits.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6136

radiosurgery (SRS) classically has been based on tumor diameter with a reduction 
of dose in the settings of prior brain irradiation, larger tumor volumes, and 
critical brain location. However, retrospective series have shown local control 
rates to be suboptimal with reduced doses. We hypothesized that lower doses 
could be effective for specific tumor biologies with concomitant systemic 
therapies. This study aims to report the local control (LC) and toxicity when 
using low-dose SRS in the era of modern systemic therapy.
METHODS: We reviewed 102 patients with 688 tumors managed between 2014 and 2021 
who had low-margin dose radiosurgery, defined as ≤14 Gy. Tumor control was 
correlated with demographic, clinical, and dosimetric data.
RESULTS: The main primary cancer types were lung in 48 (47.1%), breast in 31 
(30.4%), melanoma in 8 (7.8%), and others in 15 patients (11.7%). The median 
tumor volume was 0.037cc (0.002-26.31 cm3), and the median margin dose was 14 Gy 
(range 10-14). The local failure (LF) cumulative incidence at 1 and 2 years was 
6% and 12%, respectively. On competing risk regression analysis, larger volume, 
melanoma histology, and margin dose were predictors of LF. The 1-year and 2-year 
cumulative incidence of adverse radiation effects (ARE: an adverse 
imaging-defined response includes increased enhancement and peritumoral edema) 
was 0.8% and 2%.
CONCLUSION: It is feasible to achieve acceptable LC in BMs with low-dose SRS. 
Volume, melanoma histology, and margin dose seem to be predictors for LF. The 
value of a low-dose approach may be in the management of patients with higher 
numbers of small or adjacent tumors with a history of whole brain radio therapy 
or multiple SRS sessions and in tumors in critical locations with the aim of LC 
and preservation of neurological function.",Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2023. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1227/neu.0000000000002556

identified. We and other investigators have found that individual psychosocial 
factors related to distress are associated with higher risk of ovarian cancer. 
The present study examined whether co-occurring distress-related factors are 
associated with ovarian cancer risk.
METHODS: Five distress-related factors were measured repeatedly over 21 years of 
follow-up: depression, anxiety, social isolation, widowhood, and, in a subset or 
women, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cox proportional hazards models 
estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ovarian cancer 
for a time-updated count of distress-related factors, in age-adjusted models, 
then further adjusted for ovarian cancer risk factors and behavior-related 
health risk factors.
RESULTS: Across 1,193,927 person-years of follow-up, 526 incident ovarian 
cancers occurred. Women with ≥3 versus no distress-related psychosocial factors 
demonstrated increased ovarian cancer risk (HRage-adjusted  = 1.71; 95% 
CI = 1.16, 2.52). No significant difference in ovarian cancer risk was observed 
in women with one or two versus no distress-related psychosocial factors. In the 
subsample with PTSD assessed, ≥3 versus no distress-related psychosocial factors 
was associated with twofold greater ovarian cancer risk (HRage-adjusted  = 2.08, 
95% CI = 1.01, 4.29). Further analysis suggested that women at highest ovarian 
cancer risk had PTSD co-occurring with any other distress-related factor 
(HR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.20, 4.01). Adjusting for cancer risk factors and health 
behaviors minimally impacted risk estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Presence of multiple indicators of distress was associated with 
risk of ovarian cancer. When including PTSD as an indicator of distress, the 
association was strengthened.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6125

opportunities to improve the infant's health. Here, we evaluated how fish oil 
and/or probiotics supplementation modify concentrations of colostrum immune 
mediators and their associations with perinatal clinical factors on mothers with 
overweight/obesity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Pregnant women were randomized in a double-blind manner 
into four intervention groups, and the supplements were consumed daily from 
early pregnancy onwards. Colostrum samples were collected from 187 mothers, and 
16 immune mediators were measured using bead-based immunoassays. Interventions 
modified colostrum composition; the fish oil+probiotics group had higher 
concentrations of IL-12p70 than probiotics+placebo and higher FMS-like tyrosine 
kinase 3 ligand (FLT-3L) than fish oil+placebo and probiotics+placebo (one-way 
analysis of variance, post-hoc Tukey's test). Although the fish oil+probiotics 
group had higher levels of IFNα2 compared to the fish oil+placebo group, these 
differences were not statistically significant after correction for multiple 
testing. Multivariate linear model revealed significant associations between 
several immune mediators and the perinatal use of medication.
CONCLUSION: Fish oil/probiotics intervention exerted a minor effect on 
concentrations of colostrum immune mediators. However, medication during the 
perinatal period modulated the immune mediators. These changes in colostrum's 
composition may contribute to immune system development in the infant.","© 2023 The Authors. Molecular Nutrition & Food Research published by Wiley-VCH

promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen receptor (AR) is the most 
critical determinant of the occurrence, progression, metastasis, and treatment 
of prostate cancer. However, the effect of FEN1 on docetaxel (DTX) sensitivity 
and the regulatory mechanisms of AR on FEN1 expression in prostate cancer need 
to be further studied.
METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses were performed using data from the Cancer 
Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus. Prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 
and LNCaP were used. FEN1 siRNA, FEN1 overexpression plasmid, and AR siRNA were 
transfected into cells. Biomarker expression was evaluated by 
immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were 
explored using flow cytometry analysis. Luciferase reporter assay was performed 
to verify the target relationship. Xenograft assays were conducted using 22Rv1 
cells to evaluate the in vivo conclusions.
RESULTS: Overexpression of FEN1 inhibited cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest 
in the S phase induced by DTX. AR knockdown enhanced DTX-induced cell apoptosis 
and cell cycle arrest at the S phase in prostate cancer cells, which was 
attenuated by FEN1 overexpression. In vivo experiments showed that 
overexpression of FEN1 significantly increased tumour growth and weakened the 
inhibitory effect of DTX on prostate tumour growth, while AR knockdown enhance 
the sensitivity of DTX to prostate tumour. AR knockdown resulted in FEN1, 
pho-ERK1/2, and pho-ELK1 downregulation, and the luciferase reporter assay 
confirmed that ELK1 can regulate the transcription of FEN1.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our studies demonstrate that AR knockdown improves the 
DTX sensitivity of prostate cancer cells by downregulating FEN1 through the

threats to human health. There is an urgent need to develop new antibacterial 
agents to effectively treat AMR infection. Herein, a novel nanozyme platform 
{Cu, N-GQDs@Ru-NO} was prepared, where Cu, N-doped graphene quantum dots (Cu, 
N-GQDs) were covalently functionalized with a nitric oxide (NO) donor, ruthenium 
nitrosyl (Ru-NO). Under 808 nm near infrared (NIR) light irradiation, {Cu,

rise as high as 70%, but such estimates rely heavily on individual behaviors, 
which in turn are correlated with knowledge and attitudes towards health and 
cancer. This paper describes the iterative evidence-based development of the 
first entertainment-education series on cancer prevention to be televised, and 
reports its effectiveness evaluation. A nominal group defined the guiding 
principles that were translated into key characteristics for a series named '2' 
Life-changing minutes'. Pilot episodes were produced and evaluated in two 
complementary studies-a focus group study with medical doctors and a survey 
study with prospective viewers. Results from these studies guided the 
optimization and production of the full series, which was broadcast on national 
public TV, in prime time. An evaluation study was performed afterwards with 
naturally-occurring viewers and results show audience reach on par with purely 
entertainment series, that health messages can be clearly conveyed through 
fictional narratives, and that the series has high levels of appreciation and 
health promotion potential. '2' Life-changing minutes' constitutes a novel and 
effective proposal for health promotion, that challenges the primacy of 
information and statistics still common in health communication, with a new 
format based on stories, characters and social contexts to successfully promote

family physicians on the use of primary health care in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a short 
online questionnaire that was sent to primary care physicians in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina from April 20th, 2022, to May 20th, 2022.
RESULTS: The research sample consisted of 231 doctors of primary health care 
from Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an average age of 45 years and 85% women. 
About 70% of participants reported having COVID-19 at least once from March 2020 
to March 2022. Participants had an average of 1,986 registered patients and 
approximately 50 encounters per day. The study revealed a high degree of 
reliability between test-retest measurements, with a single measure Intraclass 
correlation coefficient of 0.801, and internal consistency determined using 
Cronbach's alpha of 0.89. Participants reported that the following health 
services were most affected during the COVID-19 pandemic: care for patients with 
chronic diseases, home visits, navigating the health system with patients making 
appointments with specialists, cancer screening, and preventive health services. 
The study also found statistically significant perceived differences in the use 
of these health services based on age, gender, postgraduate education in family 
medicine, participation in COVID-19 clinics, and personal history of Covid-19.
CONCLUSION: There were significant disturbances to the use of primary health 
care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research could investigate patient 
outcomes compared to family physician perceptions.","Copyright © 2023 Jatić et al. This article is available under a Creative Commons

METHODS: A total of 809 cases of biopsy-proven, non-metastatic CC were 
identified from an academic cancer center. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 
method was used to develop the refined staging systems with respect to overall 
survival (OS). Internal validation was performed by using calibration curve with 
1000 bootstrap resampling. Performances of the RPA-refined stages were compared 
against the conventional FIGO 2018 and 9th edition TNM-stage classifications by 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and decision curve analysis

RESULTS: We identified that CUI was independently prognostic for death and 
relapse in our cohort. RPA modeling using a two-tiered stratification by CUI

adenocarcinoma (PDAC) greatly restricts clinical outcomes. Major obstacles to 
PDAC treatment include restricted immune cell infiltration and drug penetration 
and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we reported a ""shooting fish 
in a barrel"" strategy by preparing a lipid-polymer hybrid drug delivery system 
(PI/JGC/L-A) that could overcome the CAF barrier by turning it into a ""barrel"" 
with antitumor drug depot properties to alleviate the immunosuppressive 
microenvironment and increase immune cell infiltration. PI/JGC/L-A is composed 
of a pIL-12-loaded polymeric core (PI) and a JQ1 and gemcitabine elaidate 
coloaded liposomal shell (JGC/L-A) that has the ability to stimulate exosome 
secretion. By normalizing the CAF barrier to create a CAF ""barrel"" with JQ1, 
stimulating the secretion of gemcitabine-loaded exosomes from the CAF ""barrel"" 
to the deep tumor site, and leveraging the CAF ""barrel"" to secrete IL-12, 
PI/JGC/L-A realized effective drug delivery to the deep tumor site, activated 
antitumor immunity at the tumor site, and produced significant antitumor 
effects. In summary, our strategy of transforming the CAF barrier into antitumor 
drug depots represents a promising strategy against PDAC and might benefit the 
treatment of any tumors facing a drug delivery barrier.","DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.3c02272

complications after liver resection. However, current studies on the risk 
factors for POBL and their impacts on surgical outcomes need to be more 
consistent. This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis to analyze the risk 
factors for POBL after hepatectomy.
METHODS: We incorporated all eligible studies from Embase, PubMed, and the Web 
of Science database (until July 2022) into this study. RevMan and STATA software 
were used to analyze the extracted data.
RESULTS: A total of 39 studies, including 43,824 patients, were included in this 
meta-analysis. We found that gender, partial hepatectomy, repeat of hepatectomy, 
extended hepatectomy, abdominal drain, diabetes, Child≥B, solitary tumor, and 
chemotherapy are the factors of grade B and C POBL. Some recognized risk factors 
were considered potential risk factors for grade B and C bile leakage because no 
subgroup analysis was performed, like HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, major resection, 
posterior sectionectomy, bi-segmentectomy, S4 involved, S8 involved, central 
hepatectomy, and bile duct resection/reconstruction. Meanwhile, cirrhosis, 
benign diseases, left hepatectomy, and Segment 1 resection were not significant 
for grade B and C bile leakage. The influence of lateral sectionectomy, anterior 
sectionectomy, S1 involved, S3 involved, high-risk procedure, laparoscope, and 
blood loss>1000 mL on POBL of ISGLS needs further research. Meanwhile, POBL 
significantly influenced overall survival (OS) after liver resection.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified several risk factors for POBL after hepatectomy, 
which could prompt the clinician to decrease POBL rates and make more beneficial 
decisions for patients who underwent the hepatectomy.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6128

disease (BD) worldwide and this is particularly prominent in low- and 
middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to compare the BD caused 
by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and related risk factors by gender in 
Mexican adults.
METHODS: We retrieved disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) estimates for 
diabetes, cancers and neoplasms, chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic 
respiratory diseases (CRDs), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) Study from 1990-2019. Age-standardized death rates were 
calculated using official mortality microdata from 2000 to 2020. Then, we 
analysed national health surveys to depict tobacco and alcohol use and physical 
inactivity from 2000-2018. Women-to-men DALYs and mortality rates and prevalence 
ratios (WMR) were calculated as a measure of gender gap.
FINDINGS: Regarding DALYs, WMR was >1 for diabetes, cancers, and CKD in 1990, 
indicating a higher burden in women. WMR decreased over time in all NCDs, except 
for CRDs, which increased to 0.78. However, WMR was <1 for all in 2019. The 
mortality-WMR was >1 for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in 2000 and <1 for 
the rest of the conditions. The WMR decreased in all cases, except for CRDs, 
which was <1 in 2020. The WMR for tobacco and alcohol use remained under 1. For 
physical inactivity, it was >1 and increasing.
CONCLUSIONS: The gender gap has changed for selected NCDs in favour of women, 
except for CRDs. Women face a lower BD and are less affected by tobacco and 
alcohol use but face a higher risk of physical inactivity. Policymakers should 
consider a gendered approach for designing effective policies to reduce the 
burden of NCDs and health inequities.",Copyright © 2023 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.7189/jogh.13.04054

clinical relevance, including exon 14 skipping, copy number gain, point 
mutations, and gene fusions. Compared with the former two, MET fusions are 
severely under-reported, leaving a series of unanswered questions. In this 
study, we addressed this gap by characterizing MET fusions in a large, 
real-world Chinese cancer population.
METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with solid tumors who had 
DNA-based genome profiles acquired through targeted sequencing from August 2015 
to May 2021. MET fusion-positive (MET+) patients were subsequently selected for 
clinical and molecular characterization.
RESULTS: We screened 79,803 patients across 27 tumor types and detected 155 
putative MET fusions from 122 patients, resulting in an overall prevalence of 
0.15%. Lung cancer comprised the majority of MET+ patients (92, 75.4%). 
Prevalence was markedly higher in liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, and renal 
cancer (range 0.52%-0.60%). It was lower in ovarian cancer (0.06%). A 
substantial proportion (48/58, 82.8%) of unique partners were reported for the 
first time. High heterogeneity was observed for partners, with ST7, HLA-DRB1, 
and KIF5B as the three most common partners. Mutational landscape analysis of 
lung adenocarcinoma (n = 32) revealed a high prevalence of TP53 in MET+ 
alterations, EGFR L858R, EGFR L861Q, and MET amplification.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is currently the largest study in 
characterizing MET fusions. Our findings warrant that further clinical 
validation and mechanistic study may translate into therapeutic avenues for MET+

very often after treatment; when only clinical parameters are used, most cases 
are diagnosed in late stages, which decreases the chance of recovery. Molecular 
markers can improve the prediction of clinical outcome. Glycolysis is altered in 
70% of CCs, so molecular markers of this pathway associated with the 
aggressiveness of CC can be identified.
METHODS: The expression of 14 glycolytic genes was analyzed in 97 CC and 29 
healthy cervical tissue (HCT) with microarray; only LDHA and PFKP were validated 
at the mRNA and protein levels in 36 of those CC samples and in 109 new CC 
samples, and 31 HCT samples by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, or 
immunohistochemistry. A replica analysis was performed on 295 CC from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
RESULTS: The protein expression of LDHA and PFKP was associated with poor 
overall survival [OS: LDHA HR = 4.0 (95% CI = 1.4-11.1); p = 8.0 × 10-3 ; PFKP 
HR = 3.3 (95% CI = 1.1-10.5); p = 4.0 × 10-2 ] and disease-free survival [DFS: 
LDHA HR = 4.5 (95% CI = 1.9-10.8); p = 1.0 × 10-3 ; PFKP HR = 3.2 (95% 
CI = 1.2-8.2); p = 1.8 × 10-2 ] independent of FIGO clinical stage, and the 
results for mRNA expression were similar. The risk of death was greater in 
patients with overexpression of both biomarkers than in patients with advanced 
FIGO stage [HR = 8.1 (95% CI = 2.6-26.1; p = 4.3 × 10-4 ) versus HR = 7 (95% CI 
1.6-31.1, p = 1.0 × 10-2 )] and increased exponentially as the expression of 
LDHA and PFKP increased.
CONCLUSIONS: LDHA and PFKP overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels was 
associated with poor OS and DFS and increased risk of death in CC patients 
regardless of FIGO stage. The measurement of these two markers could be very 
useful for evaluating clinical evolution and the risk of death from CC and could 
facilitate better treatment decision making.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6123

inhibitor), Gedatolisib (PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor) and PD0325901 (MEK1/2 
inhibitor) in colorectal cancer (CRC), however single agent therapeutics are 
often limited by the development of resistance.
METHODS: We compared the anti-proliferative effects of the combination of 
Gedatolisib and Palbociclib and Gedatolisib and PD0325901 in five CRC cell lines 
with varying mutational background and tested their combinations on total and 
phosphoprotein levels of signaling pathway proteins.
RESULTS: The combination of Palbociclib and Gedatolisib was superior to the 
combination of Palbociclib and PD0325901. The combination of Palbociclib and 
Gedatolisib had synergistic anti-proliferative effects in all cell lines tested 
[CI range: 0.11-0.69] and resulted in the suppression of S6rp (S240/244), 
without AKT reactivation. The combination of Palbociclib and Gedatolisib 
increased BAX and Bcl-2 levels in PIK3CA mutated cell lines. The combination of 
Palbociclib and Gedatolisib caused MAPK/ERK reactivation, as seen by an increase 
in expression of total EGFR, regardless of the mutational status of the cells.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the combination of Palbociclib and Gedatolisib 
has synergistic anti-proliferative effects in both wild-type and mutated CRC 
cell lines. Separately, the phosphorylation of S6rp may be a promising biomarker 
of responsiveness to this combination.","DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2023.2223388

patients and five breast cancer cell lines. However, its precise role and 
molecular mechanisms in breast cancer remain completely unknown. Herein, we 
found that knockdown of ARHGAP25 in breast cancer cells promoted proliferation, 
migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, ARHGAP25 silence 
facilitated the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the upregulation of 
its downstream molecules (including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, PCNA, MMP2, MMP9, Snail, 
and ASCL2) by directly regulating Rac1/PAK1 in breast cancer cells. In vivo 
xenograft experiments indicated ARHGAP25 silence promoted tumor growth and 
activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In contrast, overexpression of ARHGAP25 in 
vitro and in vivo impeded all of the above cancer properties. Intriguingly, 
ASCL2, a downstream target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, transcriptionally 
repressed the expression of ARHGAP25 and therefore constituted a negative 
feedback loop. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis indicated that ARHGAP25 is 
significantly correlated with tumor immune cell infiltration and the survival of 
patients with different immune cell subgroups in breast cancer. Collectively, 
our work revealed that ARHGAP25 suppressed tumor progression of breast cancer.

poor prognoses and high rates of recurrence after resection. Patient-derived 
xenografts (PDX), created from surgical specimens, provide a reliable 
preclinical research platform and high-fidelity cancer model from which to study 
these malignancies with consistent recapitulation of their original patient 
tumors in vivo. However, the relationship between PDX engraftment success 
(growth or no growth) and patient oncological outcomes has not been well 
studied. We sought to evaluate the correlation between successful PDX 
engraftment and survival in several PB exocrine carcinomas including pancreatic 
and biliary tract.
STUDY DESIGN: In accordance with IRB and IACUC protocols and with appropriate 
consent and approval, excess tumor tissue obtained from surgical patients was 
implanted into immunocompromised mice. Mice were monitored for tumor growth to 
determine engraftment success. PDX tumors were verified to recapitulate their 
tumors of origin by a hepatobiliary pathologist. Xenograft growth was correlated 
with clinical recurrence and overall survival data.
RESULTS: 384 PB xenografts were implanted. The successful engraftment rate was 
41% (158/384). We found that successful PDX engraftment highly associated with 
both recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001) and overall survival (p < 0.001) 
outcomes. Furthermore, successful PDX tumor generation occurs significantly in 
advance of clinical recurrences in their corresponding patients (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Successful PB cancer PDX models predict recurrence and survival 
across tumor types and may provide critical lead time to alter patients' 
surveillance or treatment plans prior to cancer recurrence.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on

first H2 antagonist of histamine receptors on the gastric parietal cell was 
introduced into therapy, inducing acid. Lasting the years, several studies 
focused on the potential relationship between inducing hypo-achlorhydria and 
risk of developing gastric cancer. In 1988 omeprazole, the first proton pump 
inhibitor, entered therapy. In 1996, Kuipers underlined the danger of 
progression of chronic atrophic gastritis in subjects taking PPIs. In 2018, one 
paper from Korea and an another on from Sweden suggested a possible relationship 
between long-term PPI therapy and the development of gastric cancer. Over the 
years, several articles, meta-analyzes and population based  focused on 
relationship between long-term of PPI use and the onset of gastric cancer, with 
conflicting results. As reported, the presence of bias in the collection of 
cases, in particular concerning the evaluation of the H.p. status and presence 
of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia in subjects treated with PPI, 
can lead to noticeable errors in the results and conclusions, as demonstrated in 
the literature by exhaustive methodological studies of pharmacoepidemiology. A 
possible bias in the collection of case histories is due to the fact that PPIs 
are often administered to dyspeptic patients, among which there are patients 
already carriers of gastric neoplasia: the so-called inverse causality.  
Literature data, amended by methodological bias (sampling errors, lack of 
comparative assessment of Hp status and atrophic gastritis) NOT support a causal

consumption in adults living with SCD. Symptomatic AVN, have higher rates of 
visits to the emergency department, higher rates of admissions, and longer 
lengths of stay in hospitals. Properly timed diagnosis and early interventions 
can reduce morbidity and enhance the quality of life in these patients. 
Vaso-occlusion secondary to sickling leads to osteonecrosis of the joint/bone 
(AVN, dactylitis) and invites infection (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). 
Understanding and awareness of the imaging features related to this major 
morbidity complication are essential for early diagnosis and prompt management. 
In about half of the patients with SCD, AVN can lead to chronic pain, 
particularly in the head of the femur and humerus. Humeral and femoral head AVN 
tend to be linked with each other.  Vertebral bone compression and collapse 
secondary to AVN have also been reported.  The diagnosis of AVN must be 
accurate, as the condition is complex requiring specific treatment according to 
the grade of bone and joint involvement. There are several classifications or 
staging systems used for grading bone and joint involvement. Knowledge of the 
image patterns and grade of affection in different joints and bones and the 
degree of progression of AVN lesions can markedly improve management decisions 
on AVN-specific surgical versus non-surgical interventions and improve patient 
outcomes. The aim of this report is to summarize the different imaging 
techniques and their role in the proper/early diagnosis and follow up of 
patients with AVN with detailed examples of the common sites involved.","DOI: 10.23750/abm.v94i3.14714

children undergoing liver transplantation and may impact postoperative outcomes. 
Our aim was to evaluate the association between volume of intraoperative fluid 
administration and our primary outcome, the duration of postoperative mechanical 
ventilation following pediatric liver transplantation. Secondary outcomes 
included intensive care unit length of stay and hospital length of stay.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using electronic 
data from three major pediatric liver transplant centers. Intraoperative fluid 
administration was indexed to weight and duration of anesthesia. Univariate and 
stepwise linear regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Among 286 successful pediatric liver transplants, the median duration 
of postoperative mechanical ventilation was 10.8 h (IQR 0.0, 35.4), the median 
intensive care unit length of stay was 4.3 days (IQR 2.7, 6.8), and the median 
hospital length of stay was 13.6 days (9.8, 21.1). Univariate linear regression 
showed a weak correlation between intraoperative fluids and duration of 
ventilation (r2  = .037, p = .001). Following stepwise linear regression, 
intraoperative fluid administration remained weakly correlated (r2  = .161, 
p = .04) with duration of postoperative ventilation. The following variables 
were also independently correlated with duration of ventilation: center (Riley 
Children's Health versus Children's Health Dallas, p = .001), and open abdominal 
incision after transplant (p = .001).
DISCUSSION: The amount of intraoperative fluid administration is correlated with 
duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation in children undergoing liver 
transplantation, however, it does not seem to be a strong factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Other modifiable factors should be sought which may lead to 
improved postoperative outcomes in this highly vulnerable patient population.",© 2023 The Authors. Pediatric Anesthesia published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/pan.14710

carcinomas (BBCs). In some cases, also radiotherapy may be a valuable weapon as 
well as ablative and topical treatments. However, all these approaches may be 
limited by some tumor features. In this scenario, locally advanced BCCs (laBCC) 
and metastatic BCC, also defined as 'difficult-to-treat' BCC, remain the real 
treatment challenge. New knowledge on BCC pathogenesis, particularly the 
Hedgehog (HH) pathway, led to the development of new selective therapies such as 
vismodegib and sonidegib. In particular, sonidegib is an orally administered 
small molecules which inhibits the HH signaling pathway through the binding to 
SMO receptor, recently approved for the management of adult patients with laBCC 
who are not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy.

(#)Contributed equally","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can manifest itself in several ways, 
including coagulopathy and thrombosis. These complications can be the first and 
sometimes only manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and can occur early or 
late in the course of the disease. However, these symptoms are more prevalent in 
hospitalized venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients, particularly those admitted 
to intensive care units (ICUs). Moreover, various forms of arterial and venous 
thrombosis, or micro- or macro-vasculature embolisms, have been reported during 
the current pandemic. They have led to harmful consequences, such as 
neurological and cardiac events, nearly all resulting from the hypercoagulable 
state caused by this viral infection. The severe hypercoagulability observed in 
COVID-19 patients accounts for most cases of the disease that become critical. 
Therefore, anticoagulants seem to be one of the most vital therapeutics for 
treating this potentially life-threatening condition. In the current article, we

(ICIs) is unpredictable due to significant interindividual variation in efficacy 
among advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The current study 
centered on the identification of perivascular blood biomarkers for predicting 
the effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) treatment 
and progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLC patients, that could be 
applied to help determine how to change treatment plans therapeutic regimens for 
optimizing clinical benefits.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of 100 advanced or recurrent NSCLC patients 
receiving anti-PD-1 therapy (Camrelizumab, pembrolizumab, sintilimab, or 
nivolumab) was conducted between January 2018 and April 2021 in Tianjin Medical 
University Cancer Hospital. The cutoff values of D-dimer were selected from rom 
our previous study, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was divided according to the 
median. Using computed tomography, tumor response was evaluated in accordance 
with the Response Assessment Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1.
RESULTS: High IL-6 level in advanced NSCLC patients was predictive of low 
efficacy and a short PFS duration after anti-PD-1 therapy. An increased D-dimer 
value of 981 ng/mL was significantly predictive of disease progression in NSCLC 
patients treated with anti-PD-1 and high D-dimer expression predictive of short 
duration of PFS. Further studies on the correlation between IL-6, D-dimer, and 
anti-PD-1 efficacy in NSCLC patients stratified by gender revealed that D-dimer 
and IL-6 levels were significantly associated with the risk of PFS in male 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: High IL-6 content in peripheral blood in patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer may contribute to poor anti-PD-1 efficacy and short 
duration of PFS through inducing alterations in the tumor microenvironment. 
D-dimer in peripheral blood is predictive of hyperfibrinolysis and contributes 
to the release of tumor-driven specific factors, leading to poor effects of 
anti-PD-1 therapy.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6222

Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.","BACKGROUND: Although some patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
show a response to immunotherapy, there are still many who do not respond. This 
suggests that various immune checkpoints are complicatedly intertwined in the 
composition of the tumor microenvironment of DLBCL.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: To comprehensively understand the expression of various 
immune checkpoint genes in DLBCL, we performed NanoString assay in 98 patients 
to investigate 579 genes. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for 
LAG-3 and PD-L1 to compare the results with expression in NanoString assay.
RESULTS: As a result of hierarchical clustering of NanoString assay, 98 DLBCLs 
were classified into three tumor immune microenvironment clusters. Most immune 
checkpoint genes showed the highest expression in cluster A and the lowest in 
cluster C. However, the expression of LAG3 was the highest in cluster C and the 
lowest in cluster A, showing an expression pattern opposite to that of other 
immune checkpoint genes. In Cluster A, the expression of genes related to T-cell 
activity such as CD8A and GZMB was increased. In Cluster C, the expression of 
genes related to major histocompatibility complex molecules was the highest. 
Immunohistochemical stains showed modest agreement with the NanoString results 
but did not help clustering.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the unique expression pattern of LAG3 in DLBCL 
contrasts with that of other immune checkpoints. We suggest that the combination 
of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-LAG-3 blockades in the immunotherapy of DLBCL 
patients can have a synergistic effect, improving the immunotherapy efficacy and

tumor-intrinsic activation of the cell cycle program impedes anticancer 
immunotherapy. Identification of cell cycle-related biomarkers may provide novel 
therapeutic targets to augment the efficacy of immunotherapy in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).
METHOD AND RESULTS: Based on the genes related to cell cycle program, two 
clusters (Cluster 1 and Cluster 2) were detected in HCC patients via 
non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Multivariable-adjusted Cox 
regression analysis indicated that the cell cycle gene-based classification was 
a significant prognostic factor for predicting the clinical outcome of HCC 
patients. Cluster 1 showed shorter overall survival time and progression-free 
interval time was associated with activated cell cycle program, higher 
infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and less sensitivity to 
immunotherapy. A three-gene prognostic model, including BIRC5, C8G, and SPP1, 
was constructed to characterize the cell cycle-based classification of HCC, 
which had strong robustness and a stable predictive performance. Notably, Birc5 
was positively correlated with CD11b expression (a MDSC marker) in HCC tissue. 
Concordant high expression of Birc5 and intratumor infiltration level of MDSCs 
were correlated with worse prognosis of HCC patients. In vitro, hepatocellular 
Birc5 overexpression promoted immunosuppressive CD11b+ CD33+ HLA-DR- MDSC 
expansion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genetically modified 
animal model of liver cancer revealed that Birc5 depletion upregulated the genes 
related to lymphocyte-mediated immunity, natural killer cell-mediated immunity, 
interferon-gamma production, T-cell activation, and T-cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity. These results suggest an immunosuppressive function of Birc5 in 
HCC.
CONCLUSION: Birc5 was a potential biomarker and inducer of intratumor 
infiltration of MDSCs, which led to T cell exclusion or dysfunction in tumor 
immune microenvironment, consequently resulting in reduced response to ICIs in 
HCC.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6271

and emerging entities. Only six cases of NR1D1-rearranged mesenchymal tumors 
have previously been reported in the literature; they are often characterized by 
an epithelioid morphology, at least focal pseudogland formation, prominent 
cytoplasmic vacuoles, and focal to diffuse immunohistochemical expression of 
keratin. We herein report the first case of an NR1D1::MAML1 epithelioid and 
spindle cell sarcoma with dual immunohistochemical expression of ERG and FOSB, 
mimicking a pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) on core biopsy. The 
sarcoma arose in the left forearm of a 64-year-old man. Initial biopsy showed a 
mesenchymal neoplasm composed of epithelioid and spindle cells dispersed in 
myxoid stroma with scattered stromal neutrophils. The morphologic features, 
combined with the dual immunohistochemical expression of ERG and FOSB, initially 
mimicked PHE, representing an important potential diagnostic pitfall. The 
patient subsequently underwent a radical resection, which showed a much more 
diffuse epithelioid appearance with nested architecture and pseudogland 
formation. Next-generation sequencing was performed on the resection specimen, 
which revealed an NR1D1::MAML1 gene fusion, confirming the final diagnosis. 
Given the fully malignant potential of this tumor, knowledge and recognition of 
this rare entity are essential to ensure proper management, prevent 
misdiagnosis, and further characterize the clinical course of this emerging 
entity. Comprehensive molecular testing can help to identify these rare tumors 
and exclude the possibility of epithelioid mimics, including PHE.","© 2023 The Authors. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer published by Wiley Periodicals

patients. Triple‑negative BC (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype. Fascin, an 
actin‑bundling protein, serves a significant role in cancer metastasis. Fascin 
overexpression is associated with poor prognosis of BC. To confirm the 
relationship between fascin expression and BC malignancy, the present study 
reviewed clinical data from 100 Japanese patients with BC and performed fresh 
immunohistochemical fascin examination of tissue samples. Statistical analyses 
showed metastasis or recurrence in 11 of 100 patients and a significant 
association between high fascin expression and poor prognosis. The TNBC subtype 
was also associated with high fascin expression. However, a few cases developed 
poor prognosis regardless of negative or slightly positive fascin expression. 
The present study established fascin knockdown (FKD) MDA‑MB‑231, a TNBC cell 
line, and investigated morphological effects of fascin on TNBC cells. FKD cells 
exhibited cell‑cell connections and bulbous nodules of various sizes on the cell 
surface. Conversely, non‑FKD MDA‑MB‑231 cells exhibited loose cell‑cell 
connections with numerous filopodia on the cell surface. Filopodia, actin‑rich 
plasma membrane protrusions, are composed of fascin and control cell‑cell 
interaction, migration and wound healing. Cancer metastasis is conventionally 
classified into two mechanisms: single and collective cell migration. Fascin 
increases cancer metastasis by single cell migration via filopodia on the cell 
surface. However, the present study suggested that following FKD, TNBC cells 
lost filopodia and exhibited collective cell migration.","DOI: 10.3892/or.2023.8587

processes in cells, such as growth, proliferation, homeostasis and regeneration. 
Their reciprocal regulation has been increasingly acknowledged in recent years: 
external physical and mechanical cues entail metabolic changes, which in return 
regulate cell mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. Since mitochondria are 
pivotal regulators of metabolism, we review here the reciprocal links between 
mitochondrial morphodynamics, mechanics and metabolism. Mitochondria are highly 
dynamic organelles which sense and integrate mechanical, physical and metabolic 
cues to adapt their morphology, the organization of their network and their 
metabolic functions. While some of the links between mitochondrial 
morphodynamics, mechanics and metabolism are already well established, others 
are still poorly documented and open new fields of research. First, cell 
metabolism is known to correlate with mitochondrial morphodynamics. For 
instance, mitochondrial fission, fusion and cristae remodeling allow the cell to 
fine-tune its energy production through the contribution of mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation and cytosolic glycolysis. Second, mechanical cues and 
alterations in mitochondrial mechanical properties reshape and reorganize the 
mitochondrial network. Mitochondrial membrane tension emerges as a decisive 
physical property which regulates mitochondrial morphodynamics. However, the 
converse link hypothesizing a contribution of morphodynamics to mitochondria 
mechanics and/or mechanosensitivity has not yet been demonstrated. Third, we 
highlight that mitochondrial mechanics and metabolism are reciprocally 
regulated, although little is known about the mechanical adaptation of 
mitochondria in response to metabolic cues. Deciphering the links between 
mitochondrial morphodynamics, mechanics and metabolism still presents 
significant technical and conceptual challenges but is crucial both for a better 
understanding of mechanobiology and for potential novel therapeutic approaches 
in diseases such as cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

/RAS mutations) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is mainly based on mCRC 
patients with proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) tumors. It is uncertain whether 
these biomarkers have the same prognostic value in mCRC patients with deficient 
mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors.
METHODS: This observational cohort study combined a population-based Dutch 
cohort (2014-2019) and a large French multicenter cohort (2007-2017). All mCRC 
patients with a histologically proven dMMR tumor were included.
RESULTS: In our real-world data cohort of 707 dMMR mCRC patients, 438 patients 
were treated with first-line palliative systemic chemotherapy. Mean age of 
first-line treated patients was 61.9 years, 49% were male, and 40% had Lynch 
syndrome. BRAFV600E mutation was present in 47% of tumors and 30% harbored a RAS 
mutation. Multivariable regression analysis on OS showed significant hazard 
rates (HR) for known prognostic factors as age and performance status, however 
showed no significance for Lynch syndrome (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.66-1.72), 
BRAFV600E mutational status (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.67-1.54), and RAS mutational 
status (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.64-1.59), with similar results for PFS.
CONCLUSION: BRAFV600E and RAS mutational status are not associated with 
prognosis in dMMR mCRC patients, in contrast to pMMR mCRC patients. Lynch 
syndrome is also not an independent prognostic factor for survival. These 
findings underline that prognostic factors of patients with dMMR mCRC are 
different of those with pMMR, which could be taken into consideration when 
prognosis is used for clinical decision-making in dMMR mCRC patients and 
underline the complex heterogeneity of mCRC.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6223

the fallopian tubes, the ovaries and the peritoneal cavity after the shedding of 
the uterus lining. To cause endometriosis, it is often necessary for these 
endometrial cells to migrate, invade and grow at the secondary site. In the 
present study, immortalized human endometriosis stromal cells (HESC) were 
employed to look for the inhibitors of migration and invasion. Using a chemical 
library of bioactive metabolites, it was found that an NF‑κB inhibitor, DHMEQ, 
inhibited the migration and invasion of HESC. Both whole‑genome array and 
metastasis PCR array analyses suggested the involvement of myosin light chain 
kinase (MLCK) in the mechanism of inhibition. DHMEQ was confirmed to inhibit the 
expression of MLCK and small inhibitory RNA knockdown of MLCK reduced cellular 
migration and invasion. The addition of DHMEQ to the knockdown cells did not 
further inhibit migration and invasion. DHMEQ is particularly effective in 
suppressing disease models by intraperitoneal (IP) administration and this 
therapy is being developed for the treatment of inflammation and cancer. DHMEQ 
IP therapy may also be useful for the treatment of endometriosis.","DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2023.13028

adenocarcinoma (PDAC); however, directly targeting NF‑κB has proven 
unsuccessful, and recent studies have demonstrated a certain effect of the 
indirect inhibition of NF‑κB. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a 
common intermediate messenger for NF‑κB activation by inducers. In the present 
study, the level of MyD88 in PDAC was detected using a public database and a 
tissue chip. A specific inhibitor (ST2825) of MyD88 was used on PDAC cell lines. 
Flow cytometry was used to examine apoptosis and cell cycle progression. 
Transcriptome sequencing was used for ST2825‑treated PANC‑1 cells compared with 
untreated PANC‑1 cells. The levels of related factors were measured using 
reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation, co‑immunoprecipitation, transcription factor assay and an 
NF‑κB phospho‑antibody array were performed to identify the detailed underlying 
mechanisms. Animal experiments were performed to verify the effects of ST2825 on 
PDAC, which were found in the in vitro experiments. MyD88 was found to be 
overexpressed in PDAC. ST2825 induced the G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis of PDAC cells. ST2825 inhibited MyD88 dimerization to inactivate the 
NF‑κB pathway. ST2825 inhibited AKT1 expression and induced p21 overexpression 
to induce G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by inhibiting NF‑κB 
transcriptional activity. NF‑κB activation, AKT1 overexpression or p21 knockdown 
partially reversed the effects of ST2825 in PDAC. On the whole, the findings of 
the present study demonstrate that ST2825 induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis via the MyD88/NF‑κB/AKT1/p21 pathway in PDAC. MyD88 may thus serve as 
a potential therapeutic target in PDAC. ST2825 may serve as a novel agent for 
the targeted therapy of PDAC in the future.","DOI: 10.3892/or.2023.8585

predominantly occurring in children and young adults. Despite optimal management 
of localized disease, approximately 50% of patients develop advanced disease. 
The management of advanced ES remains challenging due to limited response to 
conventional chemotherapy and despite novel oral EZH2 inhibitors that have 
better tolerability but similar efficacy to chemotherapy.
AREAS COVERED: We performed a literature review using the PubMed (MEDLINE), Web 
of Science databases. We have focused on the role of chemotherapy, targeted 
agents such as EZH2 inhibitors, potential new targets and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and combinations of therapies currently undergoing clinical 
investigation.
EXPERT OPINION: ES is a soft tissue sarcoma with a heterogeneous pathological, 
clinical and molecular presentation. In the current era of precision medicine, 
more trials with targeted therapies and a combination of chemotherapy or 
immunotherapy with targeted therapies are required to establish optimal 
treatment for ES.","DOI: 10.1080/14656566.2023.2224500

difficulties (57.18±12.45) and fatigue with a score of 50.12±10.86 on a 
100-point scale. According to the QLQ-STO22 symptom scale in the study of 
patients, anxiety (59.07±12.46) and hair loss (56.97±11.78) amounted to the 
highest scores.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Given the low quality of life of gastric cancer 
patients, they need psychological support, which is aimed at adapting to the 
manifestations of the disease and should be a mandatory component in the 
development of models or strategies for providing medical care to cancer 
patients. Standardized psychological care should be organized at all stages of 
diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation in all institutions that provide 
treatment to gastric cancer pa¬tients. It is also important to develop and 
implement a comprehensive program to support gastric cancer patients in 
interaction with society, family and work.","DOI: 10.36740/WLek202305111

associated with development of diseases such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, fatty 
liver disease, hypertension, and cancer. The present study aimed to identify the 
mechanism of action related to the anti‑obesity activity of Paeonia lactiflora 
root (PLR) based on its effects on lipid droplet accumulation. The inhibitory 
activity on lipid accumulation was analyzed through Oil‑Red O staining, and the 
changes in levels of lipid accumulation‑related proteins were analyzed using 
Western blot analysis. And the contents of triacylglycerol and free glycerol 
were analyzed using an ELISA Kit. PLR significantly inhibited the accumulation 
of lipid droplets and triacylglycerol in differentiating 3T3‑L1 cells. PLR 
increased phosphorylated‑hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), HSL and adipose 
triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and decreases perilipin‑1 in differentiating and 
fully differentiated 3T3‑L1 cells. Furthermore, treatment of fully 
differentiated 3T3‑L1 cells with PLR resulted in increased free glycerol levels. 
PLR treatment increased levels of peroxisome proliferator‑activated 
receptor‑gamma coactivator‑1 alpha (PGC‑1α), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) 
and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP‑1) in both differentiating and fully 
differentiated 3T3‑L1 cells. However, the PLR‑mediated increase in lipolytic, 
such as ATGL and HSL, and thermogenic factors, such as PGC‑1a and UCP‑1, were 
decreased by inhibition of AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) with Compound C. 
Taken together, these results suggest that PLR exerted anti‑obesity effects by 
regulating lipolytic and thermogenic factors via AMPK activation. Therefore, the 
present study provided evidence that PLR is a potential natural agent for the 
development of drugs to control obesity.","DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2023.5268

fourth most common female malignancy worldwide. However, some patients progress 
to chemotherapy resistance, which leads to chemotherapy failure, tumor 
recurrence, and poor prognosis. Therefore, strategies to identify the regulatory 
mechanisms underlying CC development and increase tumor sensitivity to DDP will 
help improve patient survival. This research was designed to ascertain the 
mechanism of EBF1-dependent regulation of FBN1 which promotes chemosensitivity 
of CC cells. The expression of EBF1 and FBN1 was measured in CC tissues 
resistant or sensitive to chemotherapy and in DDP-sensitive or -resistant cells 
(SiHa and SiHa-DDP cells). SiHa-DDP cells were transduced with lentiviruses 
encoding EBF1 or FBN1 to evaluate the influence of these two proteins on cell 
viability, expression of MDR1 and MRP1, and cell aggressiveness. Moreover, the 
interaction between EBF1 and FBN1 was predicted and demonstrated. Finally, to 
further verify the EBF1/FB1-dependent mechanism of DDP sensitivity regulation in 
CC cells a xenograft mouse model of CC was established using SiHa-DDP cells 
transduced with lentiviruses carrying EBF1 gene and shRNA directed to FBN1 EBF1 
and FBN1 showed decreased expression in CC tissues and cells, particularly in 
those resistant to chemotherapy. Transduction of SiHa-DDP cells with 
lentiviruses encoding EBF1 or FBN1 lead to decreased viability, IC50, 
proliferation capacity, colony formation ability, aggressiveness, and increased 
cell apoptosis. We have shown that EBF1 activates FBN1 transcription by binding 
to FBN1 promoter region. Additionally, it was revealed that FBN1 silencing 
reversed the promoting effect of EBF1 overexpression on chemosensitivity of CC 
cells in vivo. EBF1 facilitated chemosensitivity in CC cells by activating FBN1 
transcription.",PMID: 37326054

Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that 
collaborates with Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase I (PARP1) in the repair of 
oxidative DNA lesions. How these proteins integrate during DNA repair remains 
largely unknown. Here, using chromatin co-fractionation studies, we demonstrate 
that PARP1 and PARP2 promote recruitment of CSB to oxidatively-damaged DNA. CSB, 
in turn, contributes to the recruitment of XRCC1, and histone PARylation factor 
1 (HPF1), and promotes histone PARylation. Using alkaline comet assays to 
monitor DNA repair, we found that CSB regulates single-strand break repair 
(SSBR) mediated by PARP1 and PARP2. Strikingly, CSB's function in SSBR is 
largely bypassed when transcription is inhibited, suggesting CSB-mediated SSBR 
occurs primarily at actively transcribed DNA regions. While PARP1 repairs SSBs 
at sites regardless of the transcription status, we found that PARP2 
predominantly functions in actively transcribed DNA regions. Therefore, our 
study raises the hypothesis that SSBR is executed by different mechanisms based 
on the transcription status.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic

quality of life (OHRQoL) of pregnant women. This study investigates the 
association between maternal oral inflammatory load (OIL), sociodemographic 
characteristics, and the OHRQoL in postpartum women.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, breastfeeding mothers were recruited 
from St. Michael's hospital, Toronto within 2-4 weeks postpartum. Mothers were 
categorized into ""Normal/low"" and ""High"" OIL groups based on the absolute counts 
of oral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (oPMNs). The Oral Health Impact Profile-14 
questionnaire was used to assess the impact of the maternal OIL on the OHRQoL. 
Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the association 
between maternal sociodemographic factors including age, marital status, 
education level, employment status, parity, and their OHRQoL.
RESULTS: Forty-seven mothers were included in this study. Mothers with high OIL 
reported higher impact on their OHRQoL (30%) than mothers with normal/low OIL 
(21%), but these differences were not statistically different. There was a 
negative relationship between the mother's education level and the extent of 
impact of OHRQoL on the ""physical pain"" dimension (P<0.05), and between the 
mothers' age and employment status and the ""physical disability"" dimension 
(P<0.05). A positive correlation was noted between multi-parity and the extent 
of impact of OHRQoL on the ""physical disability"" dimension (P = 0.009), and 
between the marital status and the ""psychological disability"" dimension 
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the significant impact of sociodemographic 
characteristics on the OHRQoL of mothers, showcasing the importance of 
considering these factors when implementing targeted preventive dental care 
programs for mothers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 (Az1, encoded by OAZ1), through the 
proteasome-mediated, ubiquitin-independent degradation of ornithine 
decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis. 
Az1-mediated degradation of other substrates such as cyclin D1 (CCND1), DNp73 
(TP73) or Mps1 regulates cell growth and centrosome amplification, and the 
currently known six Az1 substrates are all linked with tumorigenesis. To 
understand whether Az1-mediated protein degradation might play a role in 
regulating other cellular processes associated with tumorigenesis, we employed 
quantitative proteomics to identify novel Az1 substrates. Here, we describe the 
identification of LIM domain and actin-binding protein 1 (LIMA1), also known as 
epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN), as a new Az1 target. Interestingly, 
between the two EPLIN isoforms (α and β), only EPLIN-β is a substrate of Az1. 
The interaction between EPLIN-β and Az1 appears to be indirect, and EPLIN-β is 
degraded by Az1 in a ubiquitination-independent manner. Az1 absence leads to 
elevated EPLIN-β levels, causing enhanced cellular migration. Consistently, 
higher LIMA1 levels correlate with poorer overall survival of colorectal cancer 
patients. Overall, this study identifies EPLIN-β as a novel Az1 substrate 
regulating cellular migration.",© 2023. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1242/jcs.260427

(mCRC) is a combination of one targeted therapy agent and a chemotherapy 
doublet. Whether bevacizumab or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 
(anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb) is the more effective addition to a 
chemotherapy doublet as the first-line treatment for inoperable KRAS wild-type 
mCRC remains controversial in prior clinical trials. Moreover, the association 
between the sidedness of primary tumors and the efficacy of anti-EGFR mAb needs 
to be addressed.
METHODS: We established a cohort of patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC who were 
treated with first-line targeted therapy plus doublet chemotherapy between 2013 
and 2018 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Secondary 
surgery was defined as either resection of primary tumors, liver metastases, 
lung metastases, or radiofrequency ablation.
RESULTS: A total of 6482 patients were included; bevacizumab and anti-EGFR mAb 
were the first-line targeted therapies in 3334 (51.4%) and 3148 (48.6%) 
patients, respectively. Compared with those who received bevacizumab, patients 
who received anti-EGFR mAb exhibited significantly longer overall survival (OS; 
median, 23.1 vs. 20.2 months, p = 0.012) and time to treatment failure (TTF; 
median, 11.3 vs. 10 months, p < 0.001). Among left-sided primary tumors, the OS 
and TTF benefits of anti-EGFR mAb remained. Among right-sided primary tumors, 
the OS and TTF were similar regardless of the type of targeted therapy. In 
multivariate analyses, first-line anti-EGFR mAb therapy remained an independent 
predictor of longer OS and TTF for left-sided primary tumors. Patients who 
received anti-EGFR mAb were more likely to receive secondary surgery (29.6% vs. 
22.6%, p < 0.0001) than patients who received bevacizumab.
CONCLUSION: For patients who received first-line doublet chemotherapy for KRAS 
wild-type mCRC, adding anti-EGFR mAb was associated with significantly longer OS 
and TTF, especially for left-sided primary tumors.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6196

cancer displaying no definitive direction of differentiation. UC has been 
reported as a highly aggressive malignant neoplasm, with a median overall 
survival of <1 year, except for several surgical series. On the other hand, UC 
tissue sometimes contains non-neoplastic osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs), and 
such cases have been reported to have relatively longer survival. Thus, the 
World Health Organization (WHO) classification histologically distinguishes UC 
with OGCs (UCOGCs) from UC, and UCs were subclassified into three subtypes: 
anaplastic UC, sarcomatoid UC and carcinosarcoma. However, still less is known 
about UC due to its rarity, and such situations lead to further difficulties in 
treatment for UC. To date, only surgical resection can offer curative treatment 
for patients with UC, and no clear evidence for chemotherapy exists for them. 
However, a retrospective cohort study and case reports showed that relatively 
promising results paclitaxel-containing regimens for treatment of patients with 
unresectable UC. Furthermore, high programmed cell death protein 1 expression 
has been reported in sarcomatoid UCs and UCOGCs, and promising responses to 
anti-programmed death-ligand 1 therapy have been described in case reports of 
UCOGCs. Recent advances in chemotherapeutic agents and molecular technologies 
are opening up the possibilities for expanded treatments.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

physical limitations associated with aging and chronic diseases are in 
development. Challenges in the framing of indications, eligibility criteria, and 
endpoints and the lack of regulatory guidance have hindered the development of 
function-promoting therapies.
METHODS: Experts from academia, pharmaceutical industry, National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) discussed optimization of 
trial design including the framing of indications, eligibility criteria, and 
endpoints.
RESULTS: Mobility disability associated with aging and chronic diseases is an 
attractive indication because it is recognized by geriatricians as a common 
condition associated with adverse outcomes, and it can be ascertained reliably. 
Other conditions associated with functional limitation in older adults include 
hospitalization for acute illnesses, cancer cachexia, and fall injuries. Efforts 
are underway to harmonize definitions of sarcopenia and frailty. Eligibility 
criteria should reconcile the goals of selecting participants with the condition 
and ensuring generalizability and ease of recruitment. An accurate measure of 
muscle mass (eg, D3 creatine dilution) could be a good biomarker in early-phase 
trials. Performance-based and patient-reported measures of physical function are 
needed to demonstrate whether treatment improves how a person lives, functions, 
or feels. Multicomponent functional training that integrates training in 
balance, stability, strength, and functional tasks with cognitive and behavioral 
strategies may be needed to translate drug-induced muscle mass gains into 
functional improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: Collaborations among academic investigators, NIH, FDA, 
pharmaceutical industry, patients, and professional societies are needed to 
conduct well-designed trials of function-promoting pharmacological agents with 
and without multicomponent functional training.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-institutional cohort study, we included 
patients with RCC with rhabdoid (RCC-R) and sarcomatoid (RCC-S) differentiation, 
who were treated with TKIs after metastasis at our institute from 2013 to 2021. 
Patient characteristics, treatments, and clinical outcomes were recorded and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: We identified 111 patients with RCC-R or RCC-S differentiations, of 
which 23 patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 23 patients, 10 
(43.5%) were grouped as mRCC-R and 13 (56.5%) as mRCC-S. At a median follow-up 
of 40 months, mRCC-R and mRCC-S progressed in 7 of 10 and 12 of 13 patients, 
respectively. In addition, four and eight patients died in the mRCC-R and mRCC-S 
groups, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of the two 
groups was 19 months (mRCC-R: 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.08-33.92) and 
7 months (mRCC-S: 95% CI 2.03-11.96), while the median overall survival (OS) was 
32 months and 21 months, respectively. mRCC-S had a worse prognosis than mRCC-R. 
Based on the univariate Cox regression model, single metastasis or multiple 
metastasis of tumor, rhabdoid differentiation, and sarcomatoid differentiation 
were predictors of PFS but not OS.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of TKIs in the treatment of mRCC-R and mRCC-S may be

90% of esophageal cancer cases in China. There are no standard regimens for 
second or third-line chemotherapy of metastatic squamous esophageal cancer. The 
objective of this study was to investigate the security and effectiveness of 
irinotecan combined with raltitrexed or irinotecan monotherapy for salvage 
chemotherapy of ESCC.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients with metastatic ESCC confirmed by 
histopathology were enrolled into this study. These patients had failure of the 
first-line chemotherapy combination of fluorouracil or platinum or paclitaxel 
and had not undergone chemotherapy with irinotecan or raltitrexed previously. 
Patients were randomly divided into irinotecan combined with raltitrexed group 
(experiment group) and irinotecan monotherapy group (control group). Overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were the primary endpoint.
RESULTS: In the control group, the median PFS (mPFS) and median OS (mOS) of 
patients were 3.37 and 5.3 months. In the experiment group, mPFS and mOS were 
3.91 and 7.0 months. There was statistical significance of PFS and OS between 
two groups (PFS P = 0.002, OS P = 0.01). In subgroup analysis, in the 
second-line treatment, the mPFS of control and experiment group, was 3.90 and 
4.60 months, mOS was 6.95 and 8.5 months, which was statistically significant 
differences between the two groups. (PFS P = 0.001, OS P = 0.005), In the

negative gastric cancer cases that potentially affect tumor progression and 
treatment response in a prospective trial.
METHODS: We collected 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (49 
HER2+ and 31 HER2-) from gastric cancer patients who participated in the TROX-A1 
trial (UMIN000036865). We queried a 435-gene panel (CANCERPLEX-JP) to generate 
comprehensive genomic profiling data, including the tumor mutation burden, 
somatic mutations, and copy number variations. In addition, the genomic 
differences between HER2+ and HER2- gastric cancer patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Mutational analyses showed that TP53 was the most frequently mutated 
gene regardless of HER2 status. ARID1A mutation was significantly enriched in 
HER2-negative patients. The number of total mutations in HER2-negative patients 
with ARID1A mutation was remarkably higher than that in HER2-positive patients. 
Next, copy number variation analyses showed that the number of amplified genes 
(such as CCNE1, PGAP3, and CDK12) in HER2-positive cases was significantly 
higher than that in HER2-negative cases. Moreover, PTEN deletion was more common 
in HER2-positive cases. Finally, we found that, compared with HER2-positive 
patients, HER2-negative patients tended to have a higher tumor mutation burden, 
particularly in patients with ARID1A mutation. Pathway analyses of the gene 
alterations showed an enrichment of several immune-related pathways in 
HER2-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the genomic profiling of HER2-positive and negative 
gastric cancer, several gene alterations in the HER2 pathway may be the 
potential mechanism underlying trastuzumab resistance. Relative to HER2-positive 
gastric cancer, HER2-negative gastric tumors with ARID1A mutation may be 
sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6269

surgery (BCS) in patients with breast cancer. However, some studies suggest that 
BCS after NAC may confer increased risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR). We 
assessed LRR rates and locoregional recurrence free survival (LRFS) in patients 
enrolled on I-SPY2 (NCT01042379), a prospective NAC trial for patients with 
clinical stage II-III, molecularly high-risk breast cancer. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to evaluate associations between surgical procedure 
(BCS vs. mastectomy) and LRFS adjusted for age, tumor receptor subtype, clinical 
T category, clinical nodal status, and Residual Cancer Burden (RCB). In 1,462 
patients, surgical procedure was not associated with LRR or LRFS on either 
univariate or multivariate analyses. The unadjusted incidence of LRR was 5.4% 
after BCS, and 7.0% after mastectomy, at median follow up time of 3.5 years. The 
strongest predictor of LRR was RCB class, with each increasing RCB class having 
significantly higher hazard ratio for LRR compared to RCB 0 on multivariate 
analysis. Triple negative receptor subtype was also associated with increased 
risk of LRR (HR 2.91, 95% CI 1.8-4.6, P<0.0001), regardless of type of 
operation. In this large multi-institutional prospective trial of patients 
completing NAC, we found no increased risk of LRR or differences in LRFS 
following BCS compared to mastectomy. Tumor receptor subtype and extent of

disease but whether is clinically different from late-onset (LO) PanNET is 
unknown. Our study aimed to evaluate clinical differences and disease outcomes 
between EO- and LO-PanNET and to compare sporadic EO-PanNET with those with a 
hereditary syndrome (HS).
METHODS: Patients with localized PanNET who underwent pancreatectomy at Memorial 
Sloan Kettering between 2000-17 were identified. Those with metastatic disease 
and poorly differentiated tumors were excluded. EO-PanNET was defined as <50 and 
LO-PanNET >50 years of age at the time of diagnosis. Family history, and 
clinical and pathology characteristics were recorded.
RESULTS: Overall 383 patients were included, 107 (27.9%) with EO-PanNET. 
Compared with LO-PanNET, EO-PanNET were more likely to have a hereditary 
syndrome (2.2% vs. 16%, P<0.001) but had similar pathology features such as 
tumor grade (P=0.6), size (2.2 Vs. 2.3 cm, P=0.5) and stage of disease (P=0.8). 
Among patients with EO-PanNET those with HS had more frequently a multifocal 
disease (65% vs. 3.3%, P<0.001). With a median follow-up of 70 months (range 
0-238), the 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence after curative surgery was 
19% (95%CI 12-28%) and 17% (95%CI 13-23%), in EO- and LO-PanNET (P=0.3). 
Five-year disease-specific survival was 99% (95%CI 98-100%) with no difference 
with respect to PanNET onset time (P=0.26).
CONCLUSION: In this surgical cohort, we found that EO-PanNET is associated with 
hereditary syndromes but has pathological characteristics and oncological 
outcomes similar to LO-PanNET. These findings suggest that patients with 
EO-PanNET can be managed similarly to those with LO-PanNET.","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005941

the most lethal tumour in both sexes. Its incidence varies not only among 
countries but also among different areas of the same country. So, the aim of 
this work was to analyse the evolution of its incidence and survival in the 
province of Castellón from 2004 to 2017 and to compare them with those of de 
rest of the country.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out from patients 
diagnosed with BC and registered in the Castellón Tumour Register from 2004 to 
2017. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method whereas to estimate 
the relationship among different variables both the chi-square and ANOVA test 
were used.
RESULTS: 4,346 cases were diagnosed, whose mean age was 67.5±11.3 years, 85.2% 
men, the most frequent histological types were adenocarcinoma (28.3%) and 
epidermoid carcinoma (25.1%). The gross global incidence was 53.4 cases/105 
inhabitants, 90.9 cases/105 men and 15.7 cases/105 women. Median global survival 
at five years was 12.7%, 12% in men and 18.4% in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The global incidence of BC in Castellón is lower than the national 
one, having remained stable in men while it is double in women. Global survival 
at five years is less than 15%, being higher in women than in men, nevertheless 
it increases compared to that of previous studies.","Publisher: OBJETIVO: El carcinoma broncogénico (CB) es el segundo tumor más

common psychological problems in breast cancer (BC) patients and ultimately 
affecting their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Heart rate variability 
(HRV) can reflect the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. However, 
the pathways through which HRV influences between FCR and HRQoL are unclear. 
This study preliminarily explored the intermediary role of HRV in FCR and HRQoL 
in BC patients.
METHODS: A total of 101 BC patients participated in this study. HRV parameters 
were measured by a 5-min dynamic electrocardiogram. FCR, psychological distress 
and HRQoL were evaluated by the Fear of disease progression simplified scale 
(FOP-Q-SF), Distress thermometer and SF-36 concise health survey. The 
intermediary effect model was established to test the intermediary effect of 
high frequency-HRV (HF-HRV) on FCR and HRQoL.
RESULTS: FCR and psychological distress were negatively correlated with HRV in 
the time domain, negatively correlated with HF-HRV in the frequency domain, and 
positively correlated with low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF). HF-HRV had a 
partial mediating effect on the FCR and physical health and mental health, with 
effects of 30.23% and 9.53%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: FCR and psychological distress are correlated with HRV parameters in 
the time domain and the frequency domain, and we preliminarily believe that 
parasympathetic nerves play an important intermediary role between FCR and 
subjective physical and mental health. This may provide intervention information 
for improving the HRQoL of BC patients.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6250

methods including the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test and the Cox 
proportional hazards model were included to examine survival differences and 
identify independent factors that may affect overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: The research enrolled a total of 202 patients. Patients with higher LY 
levels and lower NLR values during radiotherapy had significantly better 
survival prognosis than those with lower LY levels and higher NLR values. 
Multivariate COX regression analysis revealed that FIGO stage I, pathological 
types of SqCC, absence of lymph node metastasis, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 
higher LY levels during radiotherapy, and lower NLR values before radiotherapy 
were independently associated with poorer PFS. Similarly, FIGO stage I, absence 
of lymph node metastasis and lower NLR values during and before radiotherapy 
were independently linked with poorer OS.

cancer (CRPC) therapies with potentially distinct associations with mental 
health symptoms given their differing antiandrogen targets.
METHODS: We used national Veterans Health Administration data to identify 
patients with CRPC who received first-line abiraterone or enzalutamide from 2010 
to 2017. Using Poisson regression, we compared outpatient mental health 
encounters per 100 patient-months on drug between the abiraterone and 
enzalutamide cohorts adjusting for patient factors (e.g., age). We compared 
mental health encounters in the year before versus after starting therapy using 
the McNemar test.
RESULTS: We identified 2902 CRPC patients who received abiraterone (n = 1992) or 
enzalutamide (n = 910). We found no difference in outpatient mental health 
encounters between the two groups (adjusted incident rate ratio [aIRR] 1.04, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.15). However, men with preexisting mental health 
diagnoses received 81.3% of the outpatient mental health encounters and had 
higher rates of these encounters with enzalutamide (aIRR 1.21, 95% CI 
1.09-1.34). Among patients with ≥1 year of enrollment before and after starting 
abiraterone (n = 1139) or enzalutamide (n = 446), there was no difference in 
mental health care utilization before versus after starting treatment (17.0% of 
patients vs. 17.6%, p = 0.60, abiraterone; 16.4% vs. 18.4%, p = 0.26,

CONCLUSION: We found no overall differences in mental health care utilization 
between CRPC patients who received first-line abiraterone versus enzalutamide. 
However, men with preexisting mental health diagnoses received the majority of 
mental health care and had more mental health visits with enzalutamide.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6237

development of cervical cancer, resulting in over 500,000 cases and 266,000 
deaths annually worldwide. Previous cervical cancer screening programs have been 
successful in reducing cervical cancer rates, but have faced challenges such as 
low acceptance and adherence rates. Innovations in screening technology, such as 
the HerSwab self-sampling test, have the potential to increase awareness, 
acceptance, and participation in cervical cancer screening programs.
AIM: This literature review examines the effectiveness of HerSwab and 
participatory innovations in increasing adherence to cervical cancer screening.
METHOD: This manuscript comprised a comprehensive narrative literature review 
encompassing the years 2006-2022. The review process adhered to the PRISMA 
diagram as a guiding framework. Among the search terms utilized, a total of 200 
articles were initially retrieved. However, after applying the predefined 
inclusion criteria, only 57 articles were included.
RESULTS: The HerSwab self-sampling test is described, including how it is 
performed, challenges, and facilitators, and evaluation and assessment of its 
effectiveness. While the HerSwab diagnostic test is not currently widely 
available, studies should assess its feasibility in less developed countries 
where cervical cancer mortality rates are high.
CONCLUSION: By increasing awareness and availability of innovative screening 
techniques, such as HerSwab, we can work toward reducing the incidence of

(NHL) survivors are scarce and those available have reported conflicting 
results. Treatment regimens vary considerably between aggressive and indolent 
NHL and studies of reproductive patterns by subtypes are warranted. In this 
matched cohort study, we identified all NHL patients aged 18-40 years and 
diagnosed between 2000 and 2018 from the Swedish and Danish lymphoma registers, 
and the clinical database at Oslo University Hospital (n = 2090). Population 
comparators were matched on sex, birth year and country (n = 19 427). Hazard 
ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression. Males and females diagnosed 
with aggressive lymphoma subtypes had lower childbirth rates (HRfemale : 0.43, 
95% CI: 0.31-0.59, HRmale : 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.78) than comparators during the 
first 3 years after diagnosis. For indolent lymphomas, childbirth rates were not 
significantly different from comparators (HRfemale : 0.71, 95% CI: 0.48-1.04, 
HRmale : 0.94, 95% CI: 0.70-1.27) during the same period. Childbirth rates 
reached those of comparators for all subtypes after 3 years but the cumulative 
incidence of childbirths was decreased throughout the 10-year follow-up for 
aggressive NHL. Children of NHL patients were more likely to be born following 
assisted reproductive technology than those of comparators, except for male 
indolent lymphoma patients. In conclusion, fertility counselling is particularly 
important for patients with aggressive NHL.","© 2023 The Authors. British Journal of Haematology published by British Society

several developing and developed countries of the world. Its mortality and 
morbidity are predicted to increase over the next decade, hence, efforts aimed 
at combating it have remained unabated. In the context of its treatment, the use 
of chemotherapeutics is often limited by challenges including 
cost-ineffectiveness, side effects, and drug resistance. Hence, medicinal plants 
are actively being explored for alternatives. In this study, Allium sativum (A. 
sativum) was explored for the discovery of key compounds that are worthy of 
exploration in the context of CRC treatment and the potential mechanism of its 
anti-CRC effects. The bioactive compounds of A. sativum were retrieved and 
subjected to drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics properties evaluation, the 
putative targets of compounds with admirable properties were predicted using 
PharmMapper while the targets of CRC were retrieved from GeneCards. The 
interactions between the targets common to both were retrieved from the String 
database while Cytoscape software was used to visualize and analyze the 
interactions. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) study revealed the biological 
processes and pathways A. sativum could potentially restore in CRC. These 
analyses revealed the key targets via which A. sativum compounds exert their 
anti-CRC properties, while molecular docking studies of the key compounds 
against the key targets revealed beta-sitosterol and alpha-bisabolene as the 
compounds with the highest binding affinity for the key targets. Ultimately, 
further experimental studies are needed to validate the findings of this

particularly T cells. Exercise during cancer reduces treatment-related side 
effects and provide a stimulus to mobilize and redistribute immune cells. 
However, it is unclear how conventional and unconventional T cells (UTC) respond 
to acute exercise in prostate cancer survivors compared to healthy controls.
METHODS: Age-matched prostate cancer survivors on androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) and those without ADT (PCa) along with non-cancer controls (CON) completed 
∼45 min of intermittent cycling with 3 min at 60% of peak power interspersed by 
1.5 min of rest. Fresh, unstimulated immune cell populations and intracellular 
perforin were assessed before (baseline), immediately following (0 h), 2 h, and 
24 h post-exercise.
RESULTS: At 0 h, conventional T cell counts increased by 45%-64% with no 
differences between groups. T cell frequency decreased by -3.5% for CD3+ and 
-4.5% for CD4+ cells relative to base at 0 h with CD8+ cells experiencing a 
delayed decrease of -4.5% at 2 h with no group differences. Compared to CON, the 
frequency of CD8+CD57+ cells was -18.1% lower in ADT. Despite a potential 
decrease in maturity, ADT increased CD8+perforin+ GMFI. CD3+Vα7.2+CD161+ counts, 
but not frequencies, increased by 69% post-exercise while CD3+CD56+ cell counts 
increased by 127% and were preferentially mobilized (+1.7%) immediately 
following the acute cycling bout. There were no UTC group differences. Cell 
counts and frequencies returned to baseline by 24 h.
CONCLUSION: Following acute exercise, prostate cancer survivors demonstrate 
normal T cell and UTC responses that were comparable to CON. Independent of 
exercise, ADT is associated with lower CD8+ cell maturity (CD57) and perforin 
frequency that suggests a less mature phenotype. However, higher perforin GMFI 
may attenuate these changes, with the functional implications of this yet to be 
determined.","© 2023 Hanson, Sakkal, Bates-Fraser, Que, Cho, Spielmann, Kadife, Violet,

subpopulations based on multiple samples of cell surface or intracellular marker 
expression level data obtained by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Cell 
subpopulations are characterized by differences in marker expression patterns, 
and cells are clustered into subpopulations based on their observed expression 
levels. A model-based method is used to construct cell clusters within each 
sample by modeling subpopulations as latent features, using a finite Indian 
buffet process. Non-ignorable missing data due to technical artifacts in mass 
cytometry instruments are accounted for by defining a static missingship 
mechanism. In contrast with conventional cell clustering methods, which cluster 
observed marker expression levels separately for each sample, the FAM-based 
method can be applied simultaneously to multiple samples, and also identify 
important cell subpopulations likely to be otherwise missed. The proposed 
FAM-based method is applied to jointly analyse three CyTOF datasets to study 
natural killer (NK) cells. Because the subpopulations identified by the FAM may 
define novel NK cell subsets, this statistical analysis may provide useful 
information about the biology of NK cells and their potential role in cancer 
immunotherapy which may lead, in turn, to development of improved NK cell 
therapies.","© (RSS) Royal Statistical Society 2023. All rights reserved. For permissions,

helps patients cognize and manage stress to improve mental health and quality of 
life. This study aimed to explore the influence of CBSM on anxiety, depression, 
and quality of life in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
METHODS: In total, 172 NSCLC patients who received tumor resection were 
randomized 1:1 into the usual care (UC) group (N = 86) and CBSM group (N = 86) 
to receive 10-week UC and CBSM interventions. Moreover, all participants 
attended a 6-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS)-anxiety score at 3rd 
month (M3) (P = 0.015) and 6th month (M6) (P = 0.018), HADS-depression score at 
M3 (P = 0.040) and M6 (P = 0.028), and depression rate at M6 (P = 0.035) were 
descended in CBSM group compared to UC group. Besides, depression severity was 
reduced at M6 (P = 0.041) in CBSM group compared to UC group, but anxiety 
severity only showed a decreased trend (P = 0.051). Additionally, Quality of 
Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) global health status score and QLQ-C30 
function score at 1st month (M1), M3, and M6 were elevated (all P < 0.05), while 
QLQ-C30 symptoms score was declined at M1 (P = 0.031) and M3 (P = 0.014) in CBSM 
group compared to UC group. Notably, the efficacy of CBSM was impressive in 
patients with baseline depression or undergoing adjuvant therapy.
CONCLUSION: CBSM is a feasible intervention that effectively improves mental 
health and quality of life in postoperative NSCLC patients.","Copyright © 2023 Wang, Zhang, Song and Han.","DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1138070

only on a patient's condition but also on the process of the patient's emotional 
adjustment to cancer. The goal of this study is to investigate aspects of the 
level of social support in oncology patients and its interconnection with 
sociodemographic and medical variables.
METHOD: The study was conducted as a prospective observational study in 2020, 
including 250 patients aged 19 and over, both sexes, with a diagnosis of 
oncological disease. The research was conducted in the Department of General 
Medicine of the Health Center Trstenik, Central Serbia, after approval by the 
Ethics Committee of the Health Center Trstenik, Central Serbia. A social support 
assessment questionnaire (Oslo-3 Social Support Scale) was used as a research 
instrument.
RESULTS: Data collected from the entire study population showed that bad social 
support was present in almost 90% of cases. Univariate and multivariate 
regression analysis showed a statistically significant influence of the 
following variables on the bad social support: education level, activity 
limitation, difficulties in performing daily activities, the impact of pain on 
the performance of activities, the need for additional help with activity, the 
need for help at home, unfulfilled needs for health care, means of information, 
anxiety score and depression score.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to increase social support may be important for 
enhancing mental health and quality of life in cancer patients.","Copyright © 2023 Corovic, Vucic, Mihaljevic, Djordjevic, Colovic, Radovanovic,

the mechanism is still obscure. The intracellular spatial distribution may be 
helpful in elucidating the mechanism. To investigate the intracellular drug 
distribution of Sch.B in cancer cells, a simple, rapid, and sensitive 
ultra-highperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-MS/MS) method was established for the determination of Sch.B in 
colorectal cancer cells. Warfarin was utilized as an internal standard. The 
sample pretreatment was carried out with protein precipitation using methanol. 
The analyte was separated on an Atlantis T3-C18 column (3 μm, 2.1∗100 mm) using 
gradient elution with a mobile phase comprised of methanol and 0.2% formic acid 
in water. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The linear range of Sch.B was 
20.0-1000.0 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient (R) more than 0.99. The matrix 
effect and recovery ranged from 88.01% to 94.59% and from 85.25% to 91.71%; the 
interday and intraday precision and accuracy, stability, specificity, carryover, 
matrix effect, and recovery all conformed to the requirements of pharmacopoeia. 
Cell viability and apoptosis assays demonstrated that Sch.B has an inhibitory 
effect in a dose-dependent way on HCT116 proliferation and achieved significant 
suppression at 75 μM (IC50). It was found that in HCT116 cell, nucleus, and 
mitochondria, exposure levels of Sch.B peaked at 36 h and then decreased, and 
mitochondria possessed more Sch.B than nucleus. These results may help to 
elucidate the antitumor effect of Sch.B.",Copyright © 2023 Bosu Meng et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/8898426

morbidity. Frontline analgesics are inadequate, providing only partial pain 
relief in only a proportion of the patient cohort. Here, we explore whether 
alterations in spinal cord vascular perfusion are a factor in reducing the 
analgesic capability of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, duloxetine.
METHOD: An established rodent model of spinal cord vascular degeneration was 
used. Endothelial-specific vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 
knockout mouse was induced via hydroxytamoxifen administered via intrathecal 
injection. Duloxetine was administered via intraperitoneal injection, and 
nociceptive behavioural testing was performed in both WT and VEGFR2KO mice. 
LC-MS/MS was performed to explore the accumulation of duloxetine in the spinal 
cord in WT and VEGFR2KO mice.
RESULTS: Spinal cord vascular degeneration leads to heat hypersensitivity and a 
decline in capillary perfusion. The integrity of noradrenergic projections (dopa 
- hydroxylase labelled) in the dorsal horn remained unaltered in WT and VEGFR2KO 
mice. There was an association between dorsal horn blood flow with the abundance 
of accumulated duloxetine in the spinal cord and analgesic capacity. In VEGFR2KO 
mice, the abundance of duloxetine in the lumbar spinal cord was reduced and was 
correlated with reduced anti-nociceptive capability of duloxetine.
DISCUSSION: Here, we show that an impaired vascular network in the spinal cord 
impairs the anti-nociceptive action of duloxetine. This highlights that the 
spinal cord vascular network is crucial to maintaining the efficacy of 
analgesics to provide pain relief.","© 2023 Da Vitoria Lobo, Madden, Liddell, Hirashima and Hulse.","DOI: 10.3389/fpain.2023.1190440

susceptibility to infections and other complications. Accurate, prompt diagnosis 
of IEI is crucial for treatment plan and prognostication. In this study, 
clinical utility of clinical exome sequencing (CES) for diagnosis of IEI was 
evaluated. For 37 Korean patients with suspected symptoms, signs, or laboratory 
abnormalities associated with IEI, CES that covers 4,894 genes including genes 
related to IEI was performed. Their clinical diagnosis, clinical 
characteristics, family history of infection, and laboratory results, as well as 
detected variants, were reviewed. With CES, genetic diagnosis of IEI was made in 
15 out of 37 patients (40.5%). Seventeen pathogenic variants were detected from 
IEI-related genes, BTK, UNC13D, STAT3, IL2RG, IL10RA, NRAS, SH2D1A, GATA2, TET2, 
PRF1, and UBA1, of which four variants were previously unreported. Among them, 
somatic causative variants were identified from GATA2, TET2, and UBA1. In 
addition, we identified two patients incidentally diagnosed IEI by CES, which 
was performed to diagnose other diseases of patients with unrecognized IEI. 
Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of CES for the diagnosis 
of IEI, which contributes to accurate diagnosis and proper treatments.","Copyright © 2023 Kwon, Cho, Hahn, Oh, Won, Shin, Kang, Ahn, Lee and Choi.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1178582

bladder, breast, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. The aim of the present study 
is to explore the prognostic value and immunotherapeutic possibilities of 
Siglec15 in gliomas using bioinformatics and clinicopathological methods.
METHODS: The bioinformatics approach was used to examine Siglec15 mRNA 
expression in gliomas based on TCGA, CGGA, and GEO datasets. Then, the 
predictive value of Siglec15 expression on progression-free survival time (PFST) 
and overall survival time (OST) in glioma patients was comprehensively 
described.The TCGA database was screened for differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) between the high and low Siglec15 expression groups, and enrichment 
analysis of the DEGs was performed. The Siglec15 protein expression and its 
prognostic impact in 92 glioma samples were explored using immunohistochemistry 
Next, the relationships between Siglec15 expression and infiltrating immune 
cells, immune regulators and multiple immune checkpoints were analysed.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analyses showed that high Siglec15 levels predicted poor 
clinical prognosis and adverse recurrence time in glioma patients. In the 
immunohistochemical study serving as a validation set, Siglec15 protein 
overexpression was found in 33.3% (10/30) of WHO grade II, 56% (14/25) of WHO 
grade III, and 70.3% (26/37) of WHO grade IV gliomas respectively. Siglec15 
protein overexpression was also found to be an independent prognostic indicator 
detrimental to the PFST and OST of glioma patients. Enrichment analysis showed 
that the DEGs were mainly involved in pathways associated with immune function, 
including leukocyte transendothelial migration, focal adhesion, ECM receptor 
interaction, and T-cell receptor signaling pathways. In addition, high Siglec15 
expression was related to M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), N2 
tumor-infiltrating neutrophils, suppressive tumor immune microenvironment, and 
multiple immune checkpoint molecules. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the 
colocalization of Siglec15 and CD163 on TAMs.
CONCLUSION: Siglec15 overexpression is common in gliomas and predicts an adverse 
recurrence time and overall survival time. Siglec15 is a potential target for 
immunotherapy and a potential TAMs regulator that is involved in the suppressed 
immunomicroenvironment in gliomas.","Copyright © 2023 Wang, Xu, Ding, Li, Wang, Xu and Liu.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1065062

gastrointestinal tract that is usually treated with a combination of 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT), and/or surgery, according to disease status. 
Despite the availability of multimodal therapeutic strategies, local recurrence 
is frequently observed. However, there is no standard treatment or promising 
therapeutic approach for local recurrence or metastatic esophageal carcinoma 
after the RT. This study tended to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
sintilimab maintenance after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for 
local/regional recurrent esophageal squamous carcinoma.
METHODS: This study was a single-arm, phase Ib/II trial conducted in a single 
site in China. Patients previously radically treated (surgery or CCRT), 
histologically confirmed, local or regional recurrence esophageal squamous 
carcinoma, qualified for the study design, were treated with 25-28 times 
radiotherapy plus raltitrexed once every 3 weeks for up to two cycles. Patients 
who have not progressed after CCRT received sintilimab as maintenance once every 
3 weeks up to 1 year. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and safety. 
Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response 
rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR).
RESULTS: Between September 2019 and March 2022, in a total of 36 enrolled 
patients, 34 pts completed CCRT. Three patients excluded due to violation of the 
exclusion criteria (1 pt) and consent withdrawal (2 pts). Finally, 33 pts were 
included in the final analysis, in which 3 pts had disease progression, and the 
remaining 30 entered maintenance therapy with sintilimab. The median follow-up 
time was 12.3 months. Median OS was 20.6 months (95%CI 10.5-NA) and the 1-year 
OS rate was 64%. Median PFS was 11.5 months (95%CI 5.29-21.3) and the 1-year PFS 
rate was 43.6%. The ORR was 63.6% (95%CI 44.6-77.8), including 2 cases of CR and 
19 cases of PR. The DCR was 19.9%, the median DOR was 19.5 months, and the 
median TTR was 2.4 months. The rate of any grade TRAEs was 96.7%; ≥Grade 3 TRAE 
was 23.4%. The incidence of immune-related AE was 60%, most of which were grade 
1-2, and only one case of thyroid-stimulating hormone increased was irAE with 
grade 3 or above.
CONCLUSION: Sintilimab has shown promising clinical efficacy and a manageable 
safety profile as maintenance therapy after CCRT for local/regional recurrent 
esophageal squamous carcinoma. In addition, further confirmation from a 
large-scale real-world study is still needed.","Copyright © 2023 Liu, Sun, Huang, Wang, Fu, Han, Zhao, Wu and Li.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193394

treating obesity. It can effectively reduce body weight and reduce the incidence 
of obesity-related breast cancer. However, there are different conclusions about 
how bariatric surgery changes breast density. The purpose of this study was to 
clarify the changes in breast density from before to after bariatric surgery.
METHODS: The relevant literature was searched through PubMed and Embase to 
screen for studies. Meta-analysis was used to clarify the changes in breast 
density from before to after bariatric surgery.
RESULTS: A total of seven studies were included in this systematic review and 
meta-analysis, including a total of 535 people. The average body mass index 
decreased from 45.3 kg/m2 before surgery to 34.4 kg/m2 after surgery. By the 
Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score, the proportion of grade A breast 
density from before to after bariatric surgery decreased by 3.83% (183 vs. 176), 
grade B (248 vs. 263) increased by 6.05%, grade C (94 vs. 89) decreased by 
5.32%, and grade D (1 vs. 4) increased by 300%. There was no significant change 
in breast density from before to after bariatric surgery (OR=1.27, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) [0.74, 2.20], P=0.38). By the Volpara density grade 
score, postoperative volumetric breast density increased (standardized mean 
difference = -0.68, 95% CI [-1.08, -0.27], P = 0.001).
DISCUSSIONS: Breast density increased significantly after bariatric surgery, but 
this depended on the method of detecting breast density. Further randomized 
controlled studies are needed to validate our conclusions.","Copyright © 2023 Sun, Huang, Dong, Zhao, Liu and Sheng.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1160809

between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and various stages of cancer 
development, including initiation, angiogenesis, progression, and resistance to 
therapy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of CAFs in 
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and develop a risk signature to predict the prognosis 
of patients with LUAD.
METHODS: We obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq 
data from the public database. The Seurat R package was used to process the 
scRNA-seq data and identify CAF clusters based on several biomarkers. 
CAF-related prognostic genes were further identified using univariate Cox 
regression analysis. To reduce the number of genes, Lasso regression was 
performed, and a risk signature was established. A novel nomogram that 
incorporated the risk signature and clinicopathological features was developed 
to predict the clinical applicability of the model. Additionally, we conducted 
immune landscape and immunotherapy responsiveness analyses. Finally, we 
performed in vitro experiments to verify the functions of EXO1 in LUAD.
RESULTS: We identified 5 CAF clusters in LUAD using scRNA-seq data, of which 3 
clusters were significantly associated with prognosis in LUAD. A total of 492 
genes were found to be significantly linked to CAF clusters from 1731 DEGs and 
were used to construct a risk signature. Moreover, our immune landscape 
exploration revealed that the risk signature was significantly related to immune 
scores, and its ability to predict responsiveness to immunotherapy was 
confirmed. Furthermore, a novel nomogram incorporating the risk signature and 
clinicopathological features showed excellent clinical applicability. Finally, 
we verified the functions of EXP1 in LUAD through in vitro experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk signature has proven to be an excellent predictor of LUAD 
prognosis, stratifying patients more appropriately and precisely predicting 
immunotherapy responsiveness. The comprehensive characterization of LUAD based 
on the CAF signature can predict the response of LUAD to immunotherapy, thus 
offering fresh perspectives into the management of LUAD patients. Our study 
ultimately confirms the role of EXP1 in facilitating the invasion and growth of 
tumor cells in LUAD. Nevertheless, further validation can be achieved by 
conducting in vivo experiments.","Copyright © 2023 Ren, Zhang, Lin, Feng, Chi, Zhang, Xia, Cai and Yu.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1201573

target immune checkpoints that suppress immune cell activity. Low efficiency and 
high resistance are currently the main barriers to their clinical application. 
As a representative technology of targeted protein degradation, 
proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are considered to have potential for 
addressing these limitations.
METHODS: We synthesized a stapled peptide-based PROTAC (SP-PROTAC) that 
specifically targeted palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC3 and resulted in the decrease 
of PD-L1 in human cervical cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry, confocal 
microscopy, protein immunoblotting, Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), and 
MTT assay analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of the designed 
peptide and verify its safety in human cells.
RESULTS: In cervical cancer celllines C33A and HeLa, the stapled peptide 
strongly downregulated PD-L1 to < 50% of baseline level at 0.1 μM. DHHC3 
expression decreased in both dosedependentand time-dependent manners. MG132, the 
proteasome inhibitor, can alleviate the SP-PROTAC mediated degradation of PD-L1 
in human cancer cells. In a co-culture model of C33A and T cells, treatment with 
the peptide induced IFN-γ and TNF-α release in a dose-dependent manner by 
degrading PD-L1. These effects were more significant than that of the PD-L1 
inhibitor, BMS-8.
CONCLUSIONS: Cells treated with 0.1 μM of SP-PROTAC or BMS-8 for 4 h revealed 
that the stapled peptide decreased PD-L1 more effectively than BMS-8.

posttranscriptional level, and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) has attracted increasing 
attention in recent years due to the improvement in RNA m5C site detection 
methods. By influencing transcription, transportation and translation, m5C 
modification of mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, lncRNA and other RNAs has been proven to 
affect gene expression and metabolism and is associated with a wide range of 
diseases, including malignant cancers. RNA m5C modifications also substantially 
impact the tumor microenvironment (TME) by targeting different groups of immune 
cells, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, granulocytes, NK cells, 
dendritic cells and mast cells. Alterations in immune cell expression, 
infiltration and activation are highly linked to tumor malignancy and patient 
prognosis. This review provides a novel and holistic examination of m5C-mediated 
cancer development by examining the exact mechanisms underlying the oncogenicity 
of m5C RNA modification and summarizing the biological effects of m5C RNA

infiltration from innate and adaptive immune subsets into the islets of 
Langerhans within the pancreas; however, the direct cytotoxic killing of 
insulin-producing β-cells is thought to be mediated primarily by 
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Despite this direct pathogenic role, key aspects 
of their receptor specificity and function remain uncharacterized, in part, due 
to their low precursor frequency in peripheral blood. The concept of engineering 
human T cell specificity, using T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR)-based approaches, has been demonstrated to improve adoptive cell 
therapies for cancer, but has yet to be extensively employed for modeling and 
treating autoimmunity. To address this limitation, we sought to combine targeted 
genome editing of the endogenous TCRα chain gene (TRAC) via CRISPR/Cas9 in 
combination with lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated TCR gene transfer into primary 
human CD8+ T cells. We observed that knockout (KO) of endogenous TRAC enhanced 
de novo TCR pairing, which permitted increased peptide:MHC-dextramer staining. 
Moreover, TRAC KO and TCR gene transfer increased markers of activation and 
effector function following activation, including granzyme B and interferon-γ 
production. Importantly, we observed increased cytotoxicity toward an 
HLA-A*0201+ human β-cell line by HLA-A*02:01 restricted CD8+ T cells engineered 
to recognize islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (IGRP). 
These data support the notion of altering the specificity of primary human T 
cells for mechanistic analyses of autoreactive antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and 
are expected to facilitate downstream cellular therapeutics to achieve tolerance 
induction through the generation of antigen-specific regulatory T cells.","Copyright © 2023 Peters, Yeh, Arnoletti, Brown, Posgai, Mathews and Brusko.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1142648

declined survival, inflamed TIME, and elevated tumor mutation burden. Besides, 
the correlation between DRG score and immune checkpoint genes and 
chemoradiotherapy-related genes indicated the implication of the model in 
personalized therapy. Furthermore, random survival forest analysis was performed 
to select the top important features within the model: POU5F1 and CTSE. qRT-PCR, 
immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry assays showed the enhanced expression 
of CTSE in BCa tumor tissues. A series of phenotypic assays revealed the 
oncogenetic roles of CTSE in BCa cells. Mechanically, POU5F1 can transactivate 
CTSE, promoting BCa cell proliferation and metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted the disulfidptosis in the regulation of tumor 
progression, sensitivity to therapy, and survival of BCa patients. POU5F1 and 
CTSE may be potential therapeutic targets for the clinical treatment of BCa.","Copyright © 2023 Chen, Yang, Li, Ma and Ji.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1198878

progression.","Cai J(1), Yang D(1), Sun H(1), Xiao L(1), Han F(1), Zhang M(1), Zhou L(1), Jiang

(1)School of Life Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, 
Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.","BACKGROUND: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell-surface serine 
protease that has both dipeptidyl peptidase as well as endopeptidase activities 
and could cleave substrates at post-proline bond. Previous findings showed that 
FAP was hard to be detected in normal tissues but significantly up-regulated in 
remodeling sites like fibrosis, atherosclerosis, arthritis and embryonic 
tissues. Though increasing evidence has demonstrated the importance of FAP in 
cancer progression, no multifactorial analysis has been developed to investigate 
its function in gastrointestinal cancers until now.
METHODS: By comprehensive use of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 
Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), scTIME Portal and Human 
Protein Atlas (HPA), we evaluated the carcinogenesis potential of FAP in 
gastrointestinal cancers, analyzing the correlation between FAP and poor 
outcomes, immunology in liver, colon, pancreas as well as stomach cancers. Then 
liver cancer was selected as example to experimentally validate the pro-tumor 
and immune regulative role of FAP in gastrointestinal cancers.
RESULTS: FAP was abundantly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers, such as LIHC, 
COAD, PAAD and STAD. Functional analysis indicated that the highly-expressed FAP 
in these cancers could affect extracellular matrix organization process and 
interacted with genes like COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 and POSTN. In addition, it was 
also observed that FAP was positively correlated to M2 macrophages infiltration 
across these cancers. To verify these findings in vitro, we used LIHC as example 
and over-expressed FAP in human hepatic stellate LX2 cells, a main cell type 
that produce FAP in tumor tissues, and then investigate its role on LIHC cells 
as well as macrophages. Results showed that the medium from FAP-over-expressed 
LX2 cells could significantly promote the motility of MHCC97H and SK-Hep1 LIHC 
cells, increase the invasion of THP-1 macrophages and induce them into pro-tumor 
M2 phenotype.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we employed bioinformatic tools and experiments to 
perform a comprehensive analysis about FAP. Up-regulation of FAP in 
gastrointestinal cancers was primarily expressed in fibroblasts and contributes 
to tumor cells motility, macrophages infiltration and M2 polarization, revealing 
the multifactorial role of FAP in gastrointestinal cancers progression.","Copyright © 2023 Cai, Yang, Sun, Xiao, Han, Zhang, Zhou, Jiang, Jiang, Li and

breast cancer patients, and healthy dietary behaviors are important for patient 
wellbeing. With the guidance of the ""Knowledge, Attitude and Practice model"" 
(KAP model), the objective of this survey was to determine the frequency with 
which patients engage in healthy dietary behaviors and to explore the 
association between healthy dietary behaviors and nutrition literacy and dietary 
attitudes.
METHODS: This study included a total of 284 breast cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy from three hospitals spanning three cities in China. Face-to-face 
interviews were conducted to collect demographic and clinical characteristics as 
well as the Dietary Nutritional Knowledge, Attitude and Practice Questionnaire 
(DNKAPQ) and the Nutrition Literacy Measurement Scale for Chinese Adult 
(NLMS-CA).
RESULTS: Participants exhibited medium to high scores for nutrition literacy, 
dietary attitude and dietary behavior. Nutrition literacy (r = 0.505, p < 0.001) 
and dietary attitude (r= 0.326, p < 0.001) scores were both positively 
correlated with the total dietary behavior score. The total nutrition literacy 
score was positively correlated with the total dietary behavior score (r = 
0.286, p < 0.001). In the univariate analysis, age, body mass index, living 
environment, education level, monthly family income, work status, menopausal 
status, number of comorbidities, relapse and endocrine therapy were 
significantly associated with dietary behavior (p < 0.05). In the multiple 
linear regression analysis, patients' dietary behavior was significantly 
associated with nutrition literacy (β = 0.449, p < 0.001) and dietary attitude 
(β = 0.198, p < 0.001). These two factors accounted for 28.6% of the variation 
in the patients' dietary behavior scores.
CONCLUSION: There is an important need for targeted dietary and nutritional 
interventions designed and implemented by health professionals to improve 
dietary behaviors. Intervention design and content should take the patients' 
nutrition literacy and dietary attitudes into consideration. In particular, 
women who are older, overweight, unemployed, and postmenopausal and live in 
rural areas, exhibit fewer comorbidities, have a lower family income and 
education level, have not relapsed and are currently receiving endocrine therapy

asthenoteratozoospermia has revealed at least 40 causative genes, which provides 
valuable reference for the genetic testing of asthenoteratozoospermia in 
clinical practice. To identify deleterious variants in the human 
tetratricopeptide repeat domain 12 (TTC12) gene in a large cohort of infertile 
Chinese males with asthenoteratozoospermia. Methods: A total of 314 unrelated 
asthenoteratozoospermia-affected men were recruited for whole exome sequencing. 
The effects of the identified variants were evaluated by in silico analysis, and 
confirmed by in vitro experiments. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was 
used to evaluate the efficiency of assisted reproduction technique therapy. 
Results and Discussion: Novel homozygous TTC12 variants (c.1467_1467delG 
(p.Asp490Thrfs*14), c.1139_1139delA (p.His380Profs*4), and c.1117G>A 
(p.Gly373Arg)) were identified in three (0.96%) of the 314 cases. Three mutants 
were indicated to be damaging using in silico prediction tools, and were further 
confirmed by in vitro functional analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and 
ultrastructural observation of the spermatozoa revealed multiple morphological 
abnormalities of flagella, with the absence of outer and inner dynein arms. 
Notably, significant mitochondrial sheath malformations were also observed in 
the sperm flagella. Immunostaining assays indicated that TTC12 is present 
throughout the flagella, and was strongly concentrated in the mid-piece in 
control spermatozoa. However, spermatozoa from TTC12-mutated individuals 
exhibited almost no staining intensity of TTC12 and outer and inner dynein arms 
components. The three men accepted ICSI treatment using their ejaculated 
spermatozoa, and two female partners successfully delivered healthy babies. Our 
findings provide direct genetic evidence that homozygous variants in TTC12 cause 
male infertility with asthenoteratozoospermia by causing dynein arm complex 
defects and mitochondrial sheath malformations in the flagellar. We also 
demonstrated that TTC12 deficiency-mediated infertility could be overcome by 
ICSI technology.","Copyright © 2023 Meng, Liu, Tan, Xu, He, Hu, Tu, Li, Du, Zhang, Lu, Fan, Lin,

transcript 1 (MALAT1) maintains the integrity of the intestinal epithelial 
barrier and regulates local inflammation. However, its influences on intestinal 
microbial communities and tissue susceptibility to cancer development remain 
unexplored. Here, we report that MALAT1 regulates host anti-microbial response 
gene expression and the composition of mucosal-associated microbial communities 
in a region-specific manner. In the APC mutant mouse model of intestine 
tumorigenesis, knocking out MALAT1 results in higher polyp counts in the small 
intestine and colon. Interestingly, intestine polyps that developed in the 
absence of MALAT1 were smaller in size. These findings highlight the unexpected 
bivalent role of MALAT1 in restricting and promoting cancer progression at 
different disease stages. Among the 30 MALAT1-targets shared by both the small 
intestine and colon, ZNF638 and SENP8 levels are predictive of colon adenoma 
patient overall survival and disease-free survival. Genomic assays further 
revealed that MALAT1 modulates intestinal target expression and splicing through 
both direct and indirect mechanisms. This study expands the role of lncRNAs in

tumors, which is difficult to be diagnosed at an early stage due to its poor 
prognosis. Despite the fact that PANoptosis is important in the occurrence and 
development of tumors, no bioinformatic explanation related to PANoptosis in 
LIHC can be found. A bioinformatics analysis on the data of LIHC patients in 
TCGA database was carried out on the basis of previously identified 
PANoptosis-related genes (PRGs). LIHC patients were divided into two PRG 
clusters whose gene characteristics of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were discussed. According to DEGs, the patients were further divided into two 
DEG clusters, and prognostic-related DEGs (PRDEGs) were applied to risk score 
calculation, the latter of which turned out to be practical in identifying the 
relationship among risk score, patient prognosis, and immune landscape. The 
results suggested that PRGs and relevant clusters were bound up with the 
survival and immunity of patients. Moreover, the prognostic value based on two 
PRDEGs was evaluated, the risk scoring model was constructed, and the nomogram 
model for predicting the survival rate of patients was further developed. 
Therefore, it was found that the prognosis of the high-risk subgroup was poor. 
Additionally, three factors, namely, the abundance of immune cells, the 
expression of immune checkpoints, and immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 
considered to be associated with the risk score. RT-qPCR results indicated 
higher positive expression of CD8A and CXCL6 in both LIHC tissues and most human 
liver cancer cell lines. In summary, the results suggested that PANoptosis was 
bound up with LIHC-related survival and immunity. Two PRDEGs were identified as 
potential markers. Thus, the understanding of PANoptosis in LIHC was enriched, 
with some strategies provided for the clinical therapy of LIHC.","Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Zhang, Pang, Li, Chen, Sun and Bian.","DOI: 10.3389/fcell.2023.1210456

SMSC function in craniofacial bone development, homeostasis, repair and 
diseases. Studies in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis identified 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling as an important signaling pathway that 
regulates cranial vault development. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies 
have since revealed the critical roles of FGF signaling in SMSCs, cranial suture 
and cranial skeleton development, and the pathogenesis of related diseases. 
Here, we summarize the characteristics of cranial sutures and SMSCs, and the 
important functions of the FGF signaling pathway in SMSC and cranial suture 
development as well as diseases caused by suture dysfunction. We also discuss 
emerging current and future studies of signaling regulation in SMSCs.","Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Erhardt, Sung and Wang.","DOI: 10.3389/fcell.2023.1112890

dysfunction which affects treatment and prognosis. This study explores the 
status, grading, and treatment strategies of coagulation dysfunction in patients 
with liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the clinical data on 
consecutive patients with cirrhosis and splenomegaly treated at Hainan General 
Hospital, China, from January 2000 to December 2020. Starting research in 
January 2022.
RESULTS: Among 1522 patients included into this study, 297 (19.5%) patients had 
normal results in all five coagulation tests (prothrombin time, prothrombin 
activity, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and fibrinogen), 
and 1225 (80.5%) had coagulation dysfunction in at least one of these tests. 
There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in treatment efficacy on these 
patients for three of these five coagulation tests, with the exception of 
prothrombin activity and thrombin time. When coagulation dysfunction was 
classified into grades I, II, and III based on scores from the three significant 
coagulation tests, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and 
fibrinogen, significant differences in surgical outcomes were found among the 
three grades of coagulation dysfunction and between grades I and III (P < 0.05). 
The operative mortality rate in patients with grade III in treating liver 
cancer, portal hypersplenism, and/or splenomegaly was 6.5%. There was no 
significant difference between patients with grades I and II (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, 80% of patients with liver cirrhosis and 
splenomegaly had coagulation dysfunction. Surgery is feasible for grade I and II 
patients. For grade III patients, nonsurgical treatment should be given first, 
and surgery should only be considered when the coagulation function returns to 
normal or near-normal levels after treatment. This trial is registered with

maintenance. This creates specific vulnerabilities that may be exploited 
therapeutically. WEE1 kinase is a key cell cycle control kinase, and it has 
emerged as a promising cancer therapy target. However, adverse effects have 
limited its clinical progress, especially when tested in combination with 
chemotherapies. A strong genetic interaction between WEE1 and PKMYT1 led us to 
hypothesize that a multiple low-dose approach utilizing joint WEE1 and PKMYT1 
inhibition would allow exploitation of the synthetic lethality. We found that 
the combination of WEE1 and PKMYT1 inhibition exhibited synergistic effects in 
eradicating ovarian cancer cells and organoid models at a low dose. The WEE1 and 
PKMYT1 inhibition synergistically promoted CDK activation. Furthermore, the 
combined treatment exacerbated DNA replication stress and replication 
catastrophe, leading to increase of the genomic instability and inflammatory 
STAT1 signalling activation. These findings suggest a new multiple low-dose

ovarian function in reproductive-aged patients?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Our study revealed that women with cancer may have decreased 
ovarian reserve markers even before cancer therapy.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: With the field 'oncofertility' improving rapidly, cancer 
therapy-mediated ovarian damage is well characterized. However, there is a 
controversy about whether cancer itself affects ovarian function before 
gonadotoxic treatment.
STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: We conducted a systematic meta-analysis 
investigating the association between cancer and ovarian function prior to 
gonadotoxic treatment. Titles or abstracts related to ovarian reserve (e.g. 
anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), or basal 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) combined with titles or abstracts related to 
the exposure (e.g. cancer*, oncolog*, or malignan*) were searched in PubMed, 
Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to 1 February 2022.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: We included cohort, case-control, and 
cross-sectional studies in English that examined ovarian reserve in 
reproductive-aged patients (18-45 years) with cancer compared to age-matched 
controls before cancer treatment. The quality of the included studies was 
assessed by ROBINS-I. Fixed or random effects were conducted to estimate 
standard or weighted mean difference (SMD or WMD, respectively) and CI. 
Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q test and I2 statistics, and publication bias 
was evaluated by Egger's and Begg's tests.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The review identified 17 eligible studies 
for inclusion. The results showed that cancer patients had lower serum AMH 
levels compared to healthy controls (SMD = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.34 to -0.03, 
P = 0.001), especially women with hematological malignancies (SMD = -0.62, 95% 
CI = -0.99 to -0.24, P = 0.001). The AFC was also decreased in patients with 
cancer (WMD = -0.93, 95% CI = -1.79 to -0.07, P = 0.033) compared to controls, 
while inhibin B and basal FSH levels showed no statistically significant 
differences.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Serum AMH and basal FSH levels in this 
meta-analysis showed high heterogeneity, and the small number of studies 
contributing to most subgroup analyses limited the heterogeneity analysis. 
Moreover, the studies for specific cancer subtypes may be too small to draw 
conclusions; more studies are needed to investigate the possible impact of 
cancer type and stage on ovarian function.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study confirmed the findings that cancer 
per se, especially hematological malignancies, negatively affects serum AMH 
level, and AFC values of reproductive-aged women. However, the lower AMH levels 
and AFC values may also be due to the changes in ovarian physiology under 
oncological conditions, rather than actual lower ovarian reserves. Based on the 
meta-analysis, clinicians should raise awareness about the possible need for 
personalized approaches for young women with cancer who are interested in 
pursuing fertility preservation strategies before anticancer treatments.

and was found to have potential in cancer treatment, especially mediated by 
copper. However, the uncoordinated delivery of disulfiram with copper and the 
instability of disulfiram limit its further applications. Herein, we synthesize 
a DSF prodrug using a simple strategy that could be activated in a specific 
tumor microenvironment. Poly amino acids are used as a platform to bind the DSF 
prodrug through the B-N interaction and encapsulate CuO2 nanoparticles (NPs), 
obtaining a functional nanoplatform Cu@P-B. In the acidic tumor 
microenvironment, the loaded CuO2 NPs will produce Cu2+ and cause oxidative 
stress in cells. At the same time, the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
will accelerate the release and activation of the DSF prodrug and further 
chelate the released Cu2+ to produce the noxious copper diethyldithiocarbamate 
complex, which causes cell apoptosis effectively. Cytotoxicity tests show that 
the DSF prodrug could effectively kill cancer cells with only a small amount of 
Cu2+ (0.18 μg mL-1), inhibiting the migration and invasion of tumor cells. In 
vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that this functional 
nanoplatform could kill tumor cells effectively with limited toxic side effects, 
showing a new perspective in DSF prodrug design and cancer treatment.",This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.,"DOI: 10.1039/d3na00004d

and a median survival of only about 15 months with standard treatment (surgery, 
radiation, and chemotherapy), which has not been significantly extended in 
decades. GBM demonstrates remarkable cellular heterogeneity, with glioblastoma 
stem-like cells (GSCs) at the apex. GSCs are a subpopulation of GBM cells that 
possess the ability to self-renew, differentiate, initiate tumor formation, and 
manipulate the tumor microenvironment (TME). GSCs are no longer considered a 
static population of cells with specific markers but are quite flexible 
phenotypically and in driving tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. In 
light of these features, they are a critical target for successful GBM therapy. 
Oncolytic viruses, in particular oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs), have 
many attributes for therapy and are promising agents to target GSCs. oHSVs are 
genetically-engineered to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, 
including GSCs, but not normal cells. Moreover, oHSV can induce anti-tumor 
immune responses and synergize with other therapies, such as chemotherapy, DNA 
repair inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, to potentiate treatment 
effects and reduce GSC populations that are partly responsible for chemo- and 
radio-resistance. Herein, we present an overview of GSCs, activity of different 
oHSVs, clinical trial results, and combination strategies to enhance efficacy, 
including therapeutic arming of oHSV. Throughout, the therapeutic focus will be 
on GSCs and studies specifically targeting these cells. Recent clinical trials 
and approval of oHSV G47Δ in Japan for patients with recurrent glioma 
demonstrate the efficacy and promise of oHSV therapy.","Copyright © 2023 Kardani, Sanchez Gil and Rabkin.","DOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2023.1206111

and radical therapeutic strategy for individuals afflicted with gastric 
carcinoma; nonetheless, certain patients exhibit unfavorable prognoses even 
subsequent to this treatment regimen. This research endeavors to devise a 
machine learning algorithm to recognize risk factors with a high probability of 
inducing mortality among patients diagnosed with gastric cancer, both prior to 
and during their course of treatment.
METHODS: Within the purview of this investigation, a cohort of 1015 individuals 
with gastric cancer were incorporated, and 39 variables encompassing diverse 
features were recorded. To construct the models, we employed three distinct 
machine learning algorithms, specifically extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), 
random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN). The models were 
subjected to internal validation through employment of the k-fold 
cross-validation technique, and subsequently, an external dataset was utilized 
to externally validate the models.
RESULTS: In comparison to other machine learning algorithms employed, the 
XGBoost algorithm demonstrated superior predictive capacity regarding the risk 
factors that affect mortality after combination therapy in gastric cancer 
patients for a duration of one year, three years, and five years posttreatment. 
The common risk factors that significantly impacted patient survival during the 
aforementioned time intervals were identified as advanced age, tumor invasion, 
tumor lymph node metastasis, tumor peripheral nerve invasion (PNI), multiple 
tumors, tumor size, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, carbohydrate antigen 
125 (CA125) level, carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA72-4) level, and H. pylori 
infection.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost algorithm can assist clinicians in identifying pivotal 
prognostic factors that are of clinical significance and can contribute toward 
individualized patient monitoring and management.","Copyright © 2023 Liu, Wang, Du, Huang, Guo, Song, Tian, Niu, Xie, Liu, Cheng and

represented by the essential subtype of RNA transcripts - the long noncoding 
RNAs (lncRNA). While this is the case, it is especially difficult to 
successfully regulate the expression of this subtype in vivo, particularly due 
to the protection granted by the nuclear envelope of nuclear lncRNAs. This study 
documents the development of a nucleus-specific RNA interference (RNAi) 
nanoparticle (NP) platform for the targeted regulation of the nuclear lncRNA 
function, in order to effectuate successful cancer therapy. An NTPA 
(nucleus-targeting peptide amphiphile) and an endosomal pH-responsive polymer 
make up the novel RNAi nanoplatform in development, which is capable of 
complexing siRNA. The nanoplatform is capable of accumulating greatly in the 
tumor tissues and being internalized by tumor cells, following intravenous 
administration. The exposed complexes of the NTPA/siRNA may conveniently escape 
from the endosome with the pH-triggered NP disassociation, following which it 
can target the nucleus by specifically interacting with the importin α/β

result in a notable suppression of the expression of nuclear lncNEAT2 as well as 
greatly impede the growth of tumors in liver cancer.","© 2022 The Authors. Exploration published by Henan University and John Wiley &

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) provide modest survival benefits. We evaluated 
the safety and antitumor activity of serplulimab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, plus 
the bevacizumab biosimilar HLX04 in this patient population.
METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study in China, patients with 
advanced HCC who failed prior systemic therapy received serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus 
HLX04 5 mg/kg (group A) or 10 mg/kg (group B) intravenously every 2 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was safety.
RESULTS: As of April 8, 2021, 20 and 21 patients were enrolled into groups A and 
B, and they had received a median of 7 and 11 treatment cycles, respectively. 
Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 14 (70.0%) patients 
in group A and 12 (57.1%) in group B. Most immune-related adverse events were 
grade ≤3. The objective response rate was 30.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
11.9-54.3) in group A and 14.3% (95% CI, 3.0-36.3) in group B. Median duration 
of response was not reached (95% CI, 3.3-not evaluable [NE]) in group A and was 
9.0 months (95% CI, 7.9-NE) in group B. Median progression-free survival was 2.2 
months (95% CI, 1.4-5.5) and 4.1 months (95% CI, 1.5-NE), and median overall 
survival was 11.6 months (95% CI, 6.4-NE) and 14.3 months (95% CI, 8.2-NE) in 
groups A and B, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Serplulimab plus HLX04 showed a manageable safety profile and 
promising antitumor activity in patients with previously treated advanced HCC.","Copyright © 2022 by The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000526638

Interpretation and Artificial Intelligence.","Minami Y(1), Nishida N(1), Kudo M(1).","Author information:
(1)Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kindai University Faculty of 
Medicine, Osaka, Japan.","BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unique among malignancies, and its 
characteristics on contrast imaging modalities allow for a highly accurate 
diagnosis. The radiological differentiation of focal liver lesions is playing an 
increasingly important role, and the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System 
adopts a combination of major features including arterial phase 
hyper-enhancement (APHE) and the washout pattern.
SUMMARY: Specific HCCs such as well or poorly differentiated type, subtypes 
including fibrolamellar or sarcomatoid and combined 
hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma do not often demonstrate APHE and washout 
appearance. Meanwhile, hypervascular liver metastases and hypervascular 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can demonstrate APHE and washout. There are 
still other hypervascular malignant liver tumors (i.e., angiosarcoma, 
epithelioid hemangioendothelioma) and hypervascular benign liver lesions (i.e., 
adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, angiomyolipoma, flash filling hemangioma, 
reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, inflammatory lesion, arterioportal shunt), which 
need to be distinguished from HCC. When a patient has chronic liver disease, 
differential diagnosis of hypervascular liver lesions can be even more 
complicated. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has been widely 
explored, and recent advancement in the field of deep learning has provided 
promising performance for the analysis of medical images, especially 
radiological imaging data contain diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive 
information which AI can extract. The AI research studies have demonstrated high 
accuracy (over 90% accuracy) for classifying lesions with typical imaging 
features from some hepatic lesions. The AI system has a potential to be 
implemented in clinical routine as decision support tools. However, for the 
differential diagnosis of many types of hypervascular liver lesions, further 
large-scale clinical validation is still required.
KEY MESSAGES: Clinicians should be aware of the histopathological features, 
imaging characteristics, and differential diagnoses of hypervascular liver 
lesions to a precise diagnosis and more valuable treatment plan. We need to be 
familiar with such atypical cases to prevent a diagnostic delay, but AI-based 
tools also need to learn a large number of typical and atypical cases.","Copyright © 2022 by The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000528538

cirrhosis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (cirr-HCC) in elderly patients 
(≥65 years of age) is scarce. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the 
outcome after LT for cirr-HCC in elderly patients in our single-center 
experience.
METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent LT for cirr-HCC at our center 
were identified from our prospectively collected LT database and stratified into 
an elderly (≥65 years) and a younger (<65 years) cohort. Perioperative mortality 
as well as Kaplan-Meier estimations of overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival 
(RFS) were compared between age strata. A subgroup analysis was performed for 
patients with HCC only inside Milan criteria. For further oncological 
comparison, outcome in the subgroup of elderly LT recipients with HCC inside 
Milan was also compared to a group of elderly patients undergoing liver 
resection for cirr-HCC inside Milan extracted from our institutional liver 
resection database.
RESULTS: Out of 369 consecutive patients with cirr-HCC who underwent LT between 
1998 and 2022 at our center, we identified 97 elderly (with a subgroup of 14 
septuagenarians) and 272 younger LT patients. 5- and 10-year OS in elderly 
compared to younger LT patients was 63% and 52% versus 63% and 46% (p = 0.67), 
respectively, while 5- and 10-year RFS was 58% and 49% versus 58% and 44% (p = 
0.69). 5-/10-year OS and RFS in 50 elderly LT recipients with HCC inside Milan 
were 68%/55% and 62%/54%, respectively, which compared to 46%/38% (p = 0.07) and 
26%/14% (p < 0.0001) in elderly patients after liver resection for cirr-HCC 
inside Milan.
CONCLUSION: Our results in almost 100 elderly patients after LT for cirr-HCC 
show that older age per se should not be considered a contraindication to LT and 
that selected elderly patients older than 65 and even 70 years benefit from LT 
as much as younger ones.","Copyright © 2022 by The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000528830

patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, progressive 
disease (PD) occurs in approximately 20% of HCC patients treated with 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, resulting in a poor prognosis. Thus, the 
prediction and early detection of HCC is crucial.
METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC treated with atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab and had baseline preserved serum (n = 68) were screened and 
classified according to their PD, 6 weeks after treatment initiation (early PD; 
n = 13). Of these, 4 patients each with and without early PD were selected for 
cytokine array and genetic analyses. The identified factors were validated in 
the validated cohort (n = 60) and evaluated in patients treated with lenvatinib.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the genetic alterations in 
circulating tumor DNA. Cytokine array data revealed that baseline MIG (CXCL9), 
ENA-78, and RANTES differed substantially between patients with and without 
early PD. Subsequent analysis in the validation cohort revealed that baseline 
CXCL9 was significantly lower in patients with early PD than that in patients 
without early PD, and the best cut-off value of serum CXCL9 to predict early PD 
was 333 pg/mL (sensitivity: 0.600, specificity: 0.923, AUC = 0.75). In patients 
with lower serum CXCL9 (<333 pg/mL), 35.3% (12/34) experienced early PD with 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, while progression-free survival (PFS) was 
significantly shorter relative to that in patients without (median PFS, 126 days 
vs. 227 days; HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.22-4.80, p = 0.0084). While patients with 
objective response to lenvatinib had significantly lower CXCL9 levels compared 
with those of patients without.
CONCLUSION: Baseline low serum CXCL9 (<333 pg/mL) levels may predict early PD in 
patients with unresectable HCC treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.","Copyright © 2022 by The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000527759

their effector function in chronic infections and cancer. The underlying 
mechanisms of action appear to differ between different types of cancer and are 
not yet fully understood.
METHODS: Here, we established a new orthotopic HCC model to study the effects of 
checkpoint blockade on exhausted CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The 
tumors expressed endogenous levels of HA, which allowed the study of 
tumor-specific T cells.
RESULTS: The induced tumors developed an immune-resistant TME in which few T 
cells were found. The few recovered CD8+ TILs were mostly terminally exhausted 
and expressed high levels of PD-1. PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade resulted in a strong 
increase in the number of CD8+ TILs expressing intermediate amounts of PD-1, 
also called progenitor-exhausted CD8+ TILs, while terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs 
were almost absent in the tumors of treated mice. Although transferred naïve 
tumor-specific T cells did not expand in the tumors of untreated mice, they 
expanded strongly after treatment and generated progenitor-exhausted but not 
terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. Unexpectedly, progenitor-exhausted CD8+ TILs 
mediated the antitumor response after treatment with minimal changes in their 
transcriptional profile.
CONCLUSION: In our model, few doses of checkpoint inhibitors during the priming 
of transferred CD8+ tumor-specific T cells were sufficient to induce tumor 
remission. Therefore, PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade has an ameliorative effect on the 
expansion of recently primed CD8+ T cells while preventing their development 
into terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs in the TME. This finding could have 
important implications for future T-cell therapies.","Copyright © 2022 by The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000526899

the mainstay in second-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). There is currently no clear evidence of superiority in efficacy or safety 
to guide choice between the two treatments.
METHODS: We conducted an anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison using 
individual patient data from the RESORCE trial of regorafenib and published 
aggregate data from the CELESTIAL trial of cabozantinib. Second-line HCC 
patients with prior sorafenib exposure of ≥3 months were included in the 
analyses. Hazard ratios (HRs) and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were 
estimated to quantify differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS). Safety outcomes compared were rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse 
events (AEs), occurring in >10% of patients, and discontinuation or dose 
reduction due to treatment-related AEs.
RESULTS: After matching adjustment for differences in baseline patient 
characteristics, regorafenib showed a favorable OS (HR, 0.80; 95% CI: 0.54, 
1.20) and ∼3-month-longer RMST over cabozantinib (RMST difference, 2.76 months; 
95% CI: -1.03, 6.54), although not statistically significant. For PFS, there was 
no numerical difference in HR (HR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.68, 1.49) and no clinically 
meaningful difference based on RMST analyses (RMST difference, -0.59 months; 95% 
CI: -1.83, 0.65). Regorafenib showed a significantly lower incidence of 
discontinuation (risk difference, -9.2%; 95% CI: -17.7%, -0.6%) and dose 
reductions (-15.2%; 95% CI: -29.0%, -1.5%) due to treatment-related AEs (any 
grade). Regorafenib was also associated with a lower incidence (not 
statistically significant) of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea (risk difference, -7.1%; 95% 
CI: -14.7%, 0.4%) and fatigue (-6.3%; 95% CI: -14.6%, 2.0%).
CONCLUSION: This indirect treatment comparison suggests, relative to 
cabozantinib, that regorafenib could be associated with favorable OS (not 
statistically significant), lower rates of dose reductions and discontinuation 
due to treatment-related AEs, and lower rates of severe diarrhea and fatigue.","Copyright © 2022 by The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000527403

Despite a great improvement of diagnostics and treatment of melanoma patients,

targets are in focus of research. EZH2 is a component of the PRC2 protein 
complex that mediates epigenetic silencing of target genes. Several mutations 
activating EZH2 have been identified in melanoma, which contributes to aberrant 
gene silencing during tumor progression. Emerging evidence indicates that long

the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, with some leading to 
non-classical clinical presentations. We present an integrated in vivo, in 
silico and in vitro investigation of an individual with CF carrying the rare 
Q1291H-CFTR allele and the common F508del allele. At age 56 years, the 
participant had obstructive lung disease and bronchiectasis, qualifying for 
Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) CFTR modulator treatment due to their 
F508del allele. Q1291H CFTR incurs a splicing defect, producing both a normally 
spliced but mutant mRNA isoform and a misspliced isoform with a premature 
termination codon, causing nonsense mediated decay. The effectiveness of ETI in 
restoring Q1291H-CFTR is largely unknown. Methods: We collected clinical 
endpoint measurements, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent 
predicted (FEV1pp) and body mass index (BMI), and examined medical history. In 
silico simulations of the Q1291H-CFTR were compared to Q1291R, G551D, and 
wild-type (WT)-CFTR. We quantified relative Q1291H CFTR mRNA isoform abundance 
in patient-derived nasal epithelial cells. Differentiated pseudostratified 
airway epithelial cell models at air liquid interface were created and ETI 
treatment impact on CFTR was assessed by electrophysiology assays and Western 
blot. Results: The participant ceased ETI treatment after 3 months due to 
adverse events and no improvement in FEV1pp or BMI. In silico simulations of 
Q1291H-CFTR identified impairment of ATP binding similar to known gating mutants 
Q1291R and G551D-CFTR. Q1291H and F508del mRNA transcripts composed 32.91% and 
67.09% of total mRNA respectively, indicating 50.94% of Q1291H mRNA was 
misspliced and degraded. Mature Q1291H-CFTR protein expression was reduced 
(3.18% ± 0.60% of WT/WT) and remained unchanged with ETI. Baseline CFTR activity 
was minimal (3.45 ± 0.25 μA/cm2) and not enhanced with ETI (5.73 ± 0.48 μA/cm2), 
aligning with the individual's clinical evaluation as a non-responder to ETI. 
Conclusion: The combination of in silico simulations and in vitro theratyping in 
patient-derived cell models can effectively assess CFTR modulator efficacy for 
individuals with non-classical CF manifestations or rare CFTR mutations, guiding 
personalized treatment strategies and optimizing clinical outcomes.","Copyright © 2023 Allan, Astore, Kardia, Wong, Fawcett, Bell, Visser, Chen,

(dMMR) in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there are only a few studies that 
have attempted to correlate CDX2 expression loss with specific MMR genes (MLH1, 
MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). This is a retrospective study of 327 patients who underwent 
surgery due to CRC. Nine patients (2.9%) had two synchronous CRCs, making the 
total sample 336 CRC. Histopathological data such as tumor type, tumor grade, 
perineural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion, pT stage, pN stage, peritumoral 
and intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration were collected and recorded in the 
database. After immunohistochemical analysis, CDX2 expression, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, 
and PMS2 deficiency were also recorded. CDX2 expression loss was detected in 19 
out of 336 CRCs (5.9%) and was associated with ascending colon CRC, partially 
mucinous adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma, and dMMR. Forty-four 
(13.1%) of CRCs were dMMR. We found a statistically significant association 
between CDX2 expression loss and MLH1 and PMS2 deficiency. Considering that most 
expression phenotypes include pairs of MMR genes, we analyzed MLH1/PMS2 and 
MSH2/MSH6 as heterodimers. Analysis of heterodimers showed a similar result, 
namely, that MLH1/PMS2 heterodimer deficiency was significantly associated with 
CDX2 expression loss. We also constructed a regression model for CDX2 expression 
loss and for dMMR. Poor tumor differentiation and MLH1/PMS2 heterodimer 
deficiency have been identified as potential predictors for CDX2 expression 
loss. CRC in the ascending colon and CDX2 expression loss have been identified 
as positive potential predictors of dMMR with rectal cancer as negative 
potential predictor of dMMR. Our study showed a significant association between 
CDX2 expression loss and MLH1 and PMS2 deficiency in CRC. We also managed to 
produce a regression model for CDX2 expression and showed that poor tumor 
differentiation and MLH1/PMS2 heterodimer deficiency are independent factors for 
CDX2 expression loss. We were the first to include CDX2 expression in a 
regression model for dMMR and showed that CDX2 expression loss can be used as a 
predictive factor for dMMR, which should be confirmed by further studies.","Copyright © 2023 Vlahović, Rajc, Švagelj, Šolić and Švagelj.","DOI: 10.3389/pore.2023.1610908

albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score in predicting clinical outcomes of pancreatic 
cancer patients after pancreatoduodenectomy with liver metastasis following 
radiofrequency ablation. Methods: This retrospective study included 90 
pancreatic cancer patients after pancreatoduodenectomy with liver metastasis 
from January 2012 to December 2018. In this study, the Chi-square or Fisher's 
exact tests, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Kaplan-Meier 
method and Log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression analyses, nomogram, calibration curves and decision curve analysis 
were used for all statistical analysis. Results: We analyzed the optimal cut-off 
value of ALBI by ROC curve, and the optimal cut-off value was -2.60. According 
to ALBI score, these patients were divided into two groups: low ALBI group (n = 
33) and high ALBI group (n = 57). Patients with low ALBI score was significantly 
related to longer progression free survival (PFS) (p = 0.0002, HR: 3.039, 95% 
CI: 1.772-5.210) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0005, HR: 2.697, 95% CI: 
1.539-4.720). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS and OS rates in low ALBI group were 
higher than those in high ALBI group. ALBI was a potential independent 
prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer patients after pancreatoduodenectomy 
with liver metastasis following radiofrequency ablation. Moreover, the nomogram 
was used to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probabilities of PFS and OS. 
The calibration curve shown that the prediction line matched the reference line 
well for postoperative 3-year PFS and OS. The DCA shown that nomogram model was 
better than the only ALBI, and indicated the ability for clinical 
decision-making, especially in 1-year PFS, and 3-, 5-year OS. Conclusion: ALBI 
is a potential independent factor for PFS and OS, and can predict the prognosis

highly immunosuppressive milieu. Key players in the immunosuppressive 
environment are regulatory myeloid cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor 
cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are recruited and 
activated via tumor-secreted cytokines such as colony-stimulating factor 1 
(CSF-1). Therefore, the depletion of tumor-secreted cytokines is a leading 
anticancer strategy. Here, we found that CSF-1 secretion by melanoma cells is 
decreased following treatment with Cannabis extracts. Cannabigerol (CBG) was 
identified as the bioactive cannabinoid responsible for the effects. Conditioned 
media from cells treated with pure CBG or the high-CBG extract reduced the 
expansion and macrophage transition of the monocytic-MDSC subpopulation. Treated 
MO-MDSCs also expressed lower levels of iNOS, leading to restored CD8+ T-cell 
activation. Tumor-bearing mice treated with CBG presented reduced tumor 
progression, lower TAM frequencies and reduced TAM/M1 ratio. A combination of 
CBG and αPD-L1 was more effective in reducing tumor progression, enhancing 
survival and increasing the infiltration of activated cytotoxic T-cells than 
each treatment separately. We show a novel mechanism for CBG in modulating the 
TME and enhancing immune checkpoint blockade therapy, underlining its promising 
therapeutic potential for the treatment of a variety of tumors with elevated

China.","BACKGROUND: Many attempts have been made to induce limb salvage as an 
alternative to amputation for primary bone cancer in the extremities, but 
efforts to establish its benefits over amputation yielded inconsistent results 
with regard to outcomes and functional recovery. This study aimed to investigate 
the prevalence and therapeutic efficiency of limb-salvage tumor resection in 
patients with primary bone cancer in the extremities, and to compare it with 
extremity amputation.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with T1-T2/N0/M0 primary bone cancer in the 
extremities between 2004 and 2019 were retrospectively identified from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database. Cox regression 
models were used to test for statistical differences between overall survival 
(OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). The cumulative mortality rates (CMRs) 
for non-cancer comorbidities were also estimated. The evidence level in this 
study was Level IV.
RESULTS: A total of 2,852 patients with primary bone cancer in the extremities 
were included in this study, among which 707 died during the study period. Of 
the patients, 72.6% and 20.4% underwent limb-salvage resection and extremity 
amputation, respectively. In patients with T1/T2-stage bone tumors in the 
extremities, limb-salvage resection was associated with significantly better OS 
and DSS than extremity amputation (OS: adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.55-0.77; p < 0.001; DSS: adjusted HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.84; 
p < 0.001). Limb-salvage resection was associated with significantly better OS 
and DSS than extremity amputation for patients with limb osteosarcoma (OS: 
adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.87; p = 0.001; DSS: adjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 
0.57-0.94; p = 0.01). Mortality from cardiovascular diseases and external 
injuries was remarkably declined in primary bone cancer in the extremities 
patients who underwent limb-salvage resection (cardiovascular diseases, 
p = 0.005; external injuries, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Limb-salvage resection exhibited excellent oncological superiority 
for T1/2-stage primary bone tumors in the extremities. We recommend that 
patients with resectable primary bone tumors in the extremities undergo 
limb-salvage surgery as the first choice of treatment.","© 2023 Zhu, Wu, Zhang and Zhang.","DOI: 10.3389/fsurg.2023.1147372

extraction surgery that can overcome the difficulty of precise transection of 
the distal rectum and subsequent anastomosis in a narrow pelvic space. 
Currently, protective ileostomy is widely utilized in low anterior resection for 
low rectal cancer, which may reduce the severe consequences caused by 
anastomotic leakage. The study aimed to combine the prolapsing technique with a 
one-stitch method of ileostomy and evaluate the surgical outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with low rectal 
cancer who underwent protective loop ileostomy in laparoscopic low anterior 
resection between January 2019 and December 2022. The patients were divided into 
prolapsing technique combined with the one-stitch method of ileostomy (PO) group 
and traditional method (TM) group, and the intraoperative details and early 
postoperative outcomes of the two groups were measured.
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients met the inclusion criteria, including 30 
patients who underwent PO and 40 patients who underwent the traditional 
procedure. The PO group had a shorter total operative time than the TM group 
(197.8 ± 43.4 vs. 218.3 ± 40.6 min, P = 0.047). The time of intestine function 
recovery in the PO group was shorter than that in the TM group (24.6 ± 3.8 vs. 
32.7 ± 5.4 h, P < 0.001). Compared with the TM group, the average VAS score was 
significantly lower in the PO group (P < 0.001). The incidence of anastomotic 
leakage in the PO group was significantly lower than that in the TM group 
(P = 0.034). The operative time of loop ileostomy was 2.0 ± 0.6 min in the PO 
group, which was significantly less than 15.1 ± 2.9 min in the TM group. Skin 
irritation was observed in 2 patients in the PO group and 10 patients in the TM 
group; therefore, there was a significant difference (P = 0.044).
CONCLUSION: This method is safe and feasible, which reduces the technical 
difficulty and achieves rapid postoperative recovery with few complications.","© 2023 Li, Tian, Chen, Liu and Tian.","DOI: 10.3389/fsurg.2023.1193265

patients had a known genetic mutation, with 21% BRCA1 and 12% BRCA2. The 
majority (73%) of prophylactic specimens had no abnormal pathology. The most 
commonly observed pathologies were atypical lobular hyperplasia (10%) and ductal 
carcinoma in situ (7%). Cancer was identified in 10% of specimens, with only one 
case of lymphovascular invasion. Thus far, there have been no incidences of 
locoregional breast cancer occurrence in this cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term breast cancer occurrence rate in this cohort of 
prophylactic NSM patients at the time of this study is negligible. Despite this, 
continued surveillance of these patients is necessary until lifetime risk of 
occurrence following NSM has been established.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf

difficult morphological reconstruction after trauma or cancer resection. There 
is also no established standard for its reconstruction; thus, we aimed to use a 
full-thickness skin graft (FTSG) over the nail plate. Three patients with Bowen 
disease on their proximal nail fold (PNF) underwent excision with a 2-mm margin 
preserving the nail matrix, and a temporary wound dressing was applied. The FTSG 
was harvested from the ipsilateral ulnar wrist joint and placed over the skin 
defect, including the nail plate. Initially, the FTSG seemed to have shrunken; 
however, after 3 months, it extended and the PNF had a good color and texture 
match. Remarkably, the FTSG adhered to the nail plate, and the complex PNF 
structure appeared well reconstructed. Occasionally, a local flap is used; 
however, it is limited to small defects and causes a deformity of the periungual 
structure. In this study, the reconstructed PNF showed good results. We presumed 
that the bridging phenomenon caused graft survival on the nail plate, and that 
the presence of stem cells near the nail matrix caused graft extension and 
eponychium and cuticle regeneration. Specifically, the acquisition of sufficient 
raw surface around the nail plate and wound preparation after excision resulted 
in the former, and the nail matrix preservation after excision contributed to 
the latter. This surgical technique is simple and can therefore be considered a 
remarkably effective method for periungual area reconstruction to date.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf

(1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical 
University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Several efficient 
treatments are available for primary prostate cancer, but an economic comparison 
of these modalities has not been done in Austria.
OBJECTIVE AND SETTING: The current study provides an economic comparison of 
radiotherapy and surgery for prostate cancer in Vienna and Austria.
METHODS: We analyzed the catalog of medical services of the Austrian Federal 
Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection and present the 
treatment costs for the public health sector with an LKF-point value and 
monetary value in 2022.
RESULTS: External beam radiotherapy, especially ultrahypofractionated, is the 
least costly treatment modality for low-risk prostate cancer, with costs of 
2,492 € per treatment. For intermediate-risk prostate cancer, differences 
between moderate hypofractionation and brachytherapy are small, with costs of 
4,638-5,140 €. In a high-risk setting, differences between radical prostatectomy 
and radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy are small (7,087 € vs. 
7474.06 €).
CONCLUSION: From a purely financial point of view, treatment of low- and 
intermediate-risk prostate cancer in Vienna and Austria should consist of 
radiotherapy as long as the current catalog of services is up to date. For 
high-risk prostate cancer, no major difference was found.",Copyright © 2023 Moll and Goldner.,"DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1016860

patients with prostate cancer residing in Turkey.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multi-institutional retrospective review including 14 
cancer centers in Turkey was conducted to include 137 Syrian refugee patients 
with prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy (RT). Toxicity data was 
scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 3.0. Noncompliance was defined as a patient missing two 
or more scheduled RT appointments.
RESULTS: Advanced disease, defined as stage III or IV, was reported in 64.2% of 
patients while androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was only administrated to 20% 
of patients. Conventionally fractionated RT with a median number of 44 fractions 
was delivered to all patients with curative intent (n = 61) while palliative RT 
(n = 76) was delivered with a median number of 10 fractions. The acute grade 3-4 
toxicity rate for the entire cohort was 16%. Noncompliance rate was 42%.
CONCLUSION: Most Syrian refugee prostate cancer patients presented with advanced 
disease however ADT was seldom used. Despite the low treatment compliance rate, 
conventional fractionation was used in all patients. Interventions are 
critically needed to improve screening and increase the use of standard-of-care 
treatment paradigms, including hypofractionated RT and ADT.","Copyright © 2023 Eren, Kilic, Eren, Kaplan, Teke, Kutuk, Bicakci, Hathout,

tract cancers. Among the types of vaginal cancer, adenocarcinoma accounts for 
only 10% with the peak incidence in women less than 20 years old. Clear cell 
type vaginal adenocarcinoma is most associated with exposure to 
diethylstilbestrol (DES) in-utero.
CASE: We present a case of an 18-year-old nulliparous woman, DES-exposure naive, 
who was diagnosed with stage I clear cell vaginal adenocarcinoma during a 
routine pelvic exam for abnormal vaginal bleeding. She underwent a 
fertility-preserving radical vaginectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy with 
neovagina creation and uterovaginal cervical reconstruction. She has been 
without disease for 28 months.
CONCLUSION: Although rare, vaginal cancer can be diagnosed on routine women's 
health exams. Early screening and diagnosis allow for innovative 
fertility-preserving surgical approaches without compromising oncologic 
outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a fertility-preserving 
radical vaginectomy, neovagina creation using a vertical rectus abdominis

of its adoption curve in urology. The goal of this narrative review is to 
provide an overview of SP-robotic partial nephrectomy (PN) 4 years after the 
introduction of the da Vinci SP dedicated platform, focusing on perioperative 
outcomes, length of stay, and surgical technique. A nonsystematic review of the 
literature was conducted. The research included the most updated articles that 
referred to SP robotic PN. Since its commercial release in 2018, several 
institutions have reproduced robotic PN by using the SP platform, both via a 
transperitoneal and a retroperitoneal approach. The published SP-robotic PN 
series are generally based on preliminary experiences by surgeons who had 
previous experience with conventional multi-arms robotic platforms. The reported 
outcomes are encouraging. Overall, three studies reported that SP-robotic PN 
cases had nonsignificantly different operative time, estimated blood loss, 
overall complications rate, and length of stay compared to the conventional 
'multi-arms' robotic PN. However, in all these series, renal masses treated by 
SP had overall lower complexity. Moreover, two studies underlined decreased 
postoperative pain as a major pro of adopting the SP system. This should 
reduce/avoid the need for opioids after surgery. No study compared SP-robotic 
versus multi-arms robotic PN in cost-effectiveness. Published experience with 
SP-robotic PN has reported the feasibility and safety of the approach. 
Preliminary results are encouraging and at least noninferior with respect to 
those from the multi-arms series. Prospective comparative studies with long-term 
oncologic and functional results are awaited to draw more definitive conclusions 
and better establish the more appropriate indications of SP robotics in the 
field of PN.","© The Author(s), 2023.","DOI: 10.1177/17562872231172834

the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. Onychomycosis is primarily caused by 
dermatophytes and affects around 5.5% of the population worldwide. Yet, only 
limited data exist on the associations between the HLA system and onychomycosis. 
Thus, the objective of the study was to investigate if there is an association 
between HLA alleles and onychomycosis.
METHODS: Participants in the Danish Blood Donor Study were defined as cases of 
onychomycosis and controls based on antifungal prescriptions in the national 
prescription registry. Associations were investigated using logistic regressions 
adjusted for confounders and were Bonferroni corrected for multiple tests.
RESULTS: A total of 3,665 participants were considered onychomycosis cases, and 
24,144 participants were considered controls. We found two protective HLA 
alleles of onychomycosis: DQB1*06:04, odds ratios (OR) 0.80 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.71-0.90), and DRB1*13:02, OR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89).
CONCLUSION: The finding of two novel protective alleles of onychomycosis 
indicates that certain HLA alleles have certain antigen presentation properties 
affecting the risk of fungal infection. These findings may provide the basis for 
future research identifying immunologically relevant antigens of fungi causing 
onychomycosis, which could ultimately lead to targets of new drugs with 
antifungal effects.","Copyright © 2023 by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000529092

as follows: (1) To identify common protective resilient factors that enabled the 
adult female cancer survivors to cope with the cancer experience. (2) To 
identify potential barriers to the resilience of adult female cancer survivors. 
Secondary objective - Phase II: The secondary objective of this study was to 
develop and validate a resilience tool for cancer survivorship.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mixed approach using sequential exploratory design was 
used in the study. A qualitative approach using phenomenology design was used in 
the first phase followed by a quantitative approach in the second phase. In the 
first phase, in-depth interviews were conducted until data saturation with 14 
female breast cancer survivors chosen by purposive and maximum variation 
sampling methods based on inclusion criteria. The researcher used Colaizzi's 
data analysis framework to analyse the transcripts. Findings were configured as 
protective resilience factors and barriers to resilience. Based on the analysis 
of the qualitative phase, the researcher developed a 35-item resilience tool for 
cancer survivorship. Content validity, criterion validity and reliability of the 
newly developed instrument were assessed.
RESULTS: In the qualitative phase, the mean age of the participants was 57.07 
years and the mean age at diagnosis was 55.5 years. The majority 11 (78.57%) of 
them were homemakers. All 14 (100%) of them had undergone surgery. The majority 
11 (78.57%) of them had all three modes of therapy, that is, surgery, 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The categories of themes identified are 
presented under two main headings, that is, protective resilience factors and 
barriers to resilience. The theme categories identified under protective 
resilience factors were personal, social, spiritual, physical, economic and 
psychological factors. The barriers to resilience identified were lack of 
awareness, medical/biological barriers, social, financial and psychological 
barriers. The developed resilience tool had a content validity index of 0.98, a 
criterion validity of 0.67, internal consistency of 0.88 and stability of 0.99 
at a 95% confidence interval. Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to 
validate the domains. PCA of protective resilience factors (Q1-Q23) and barriers 
to resilience (Q24-Q35) had Eigenvalues of 7.65 and 4.49, respectively. The 
resilience tool for cancer survivorship was found to have good construct 
validity.
CONCLUSION: The present study has identified the protective resilience factors 
and barriers to resilience among adult female cancer survivors. The developed 
resilience tool for cancer survivorship was found to have good validity and 
reliability. It will be useful for nurses and all other healthcare professionals 
to assess the resilience needs of cancer survivors and to provide need-based 
quality cancer care.","© 2023 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Indian Journal of Palliative

Maebashi, Japan.","OBJECTIVES: Palliative care is essential for patients requiring respiratory 
assistance through non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). This study 
aimed to describe nurses' perception of individuals with NPPV and non-cancer 
terminal diseases in various clinical settings.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This qualitative and descriptive study was conducted using 
semi-structured interviews with audio recordings with advanced practice nurses 
from different clinical settings and obtained their perceptions of end-of-life 
care for patients with NPPV.
RESULTS: Five categories of nurses' perceptions were extracted: Difficulty with 
an uncertain prognosis, differences in symptom management by type of disease, 
benefits and weaknesses of NPPV on palliative care, influence of physicians' 
attitude toward palliative care and the nature of the medical institutions and 
influence of patient's age in palliative care.
CONCLUSION: The nurses' perceptions showed differences and similarities across 
disease types. There is a need for skills improvement regardless of disease type 
to minimise the side effects of NPPV. Advanced care planning based on 
disease-specific characteristics and age-appropriate support and integration of 
palliative care into acute care is needed for terminal NPPV-dependent patients. 
Interdisciplinary efforts, as well as the pursuit of expertise in each field, 
are needed to provide good palliative and end-of-life care for NPPV users with 
non-cancer diseases.","© 2023 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Indian Journal of Palliative

makes up for up to 29% of all registered cancer in females. Cancer-related pain 
is one of the major distressing symptoms for all cancer patients. Pain is 
characterised as somatic or neuropathic, and the total pain experience is often 
mixed. Conventional opioids are the backbone of analgesic treatment but are most 
often not sufficient in alleviating neuropathic pain, common in cervical cancer. 
Accumulating evidence of the advantage of methadone compared to conventional 
opioids, due to agonist action at both μ and q opioid receptors, 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist activity and the ability to inhibit the 
reuptake of monoamines has been demonstrated. We hypothesised that, with these 
properties', methadone might be a good option for the treatment of neuropathic 
pain in patients with cervical cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with cervical cancer stages ll-lll were enrolled 
in this randomized controlled trial. A comparison was made between methadone 
versus immediate release morphine (IR morphine), with increasing doses until 
pain was controlled. Inclusion-period was from October 3rd to December 31st 
2020, and the total patient-study period was 12 weeks. Pain intensity was 
assessed according to the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Douleur Neuropathique 
(DN4). The primary objective was to determine whether methadone was clinically 
superior versus noninferior to morphine as an analgesic for the treatment of 
cancer related neuropathic pain in women with cervical cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 85 women were included; five withdrew and six died during 
the study period, leaving 74 patients completing the study. All participants 
showed a reduction in mean values of NRS and DN4 from the time of inclusion and 
to the end of the study period, for IR morphine and methadone 8.4-2.7 and 
8.6-1.5, respectively (P < 0.001). The DN4 score mean reduction for Morphine and 
Methadone were 6.12-1.37 and 6.05-0, respectively (P < 0.001). Side effects were 
more common in the group of patients receiving IR morphine compared to the 
patients treated with methadone.
CONCLUSION: We found that Methadone had a superior analgesic effect with good 
overall tolerability compared with morphine as a first-line strong opioid for 
the management of cancer-related neuropathic pain.","© 2023 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Indian Journal of Palliative

challenges in comparison to other types of cancers. Sources of psychosocial 
distress (PSD) are multifactorial and recognising the key attributes would 
facilitate better understanding of the experienced distress, potentially 
enabling directed intervention strategies. The present research was conducted to 
explore the key attributes of PSD from HNC patients' perspective to develop a 
tool.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study adopted a qualitative approach. The data were 
collected from nine HNC patients receiving radiotherapy through focus group 
discussion. Data were transcribed, read and reread through for searching the 
meanings and patterns, to familiarise with the data and obtain ideas on 
experiences related to PSD. Similar experiences identified across the dataset 
were sorted and then collated into themes. Detailed analysis of themes and 
related quotes of the participants are reported with each theme.
RESULTS: The codes generated from the study are grouped under four major themes; 
'Irksome symptoms are distressing,' 'Distressing physical disability inflicted 
by the situation,' 'Social Curiosity - a distressing element' and 'Distressing 
uncertainty of future'. The attributes of PSD and the magnitude of psychosocial 
problems were reflected in the findings.
CONCLUSION: Psychosocial health of HNC patients is greatly impacted due to 
disease and/or treatment. Dynamic patterns of attributes identified from the 
study contributed to developing a tool on PSD. The findings of this study also 
necessitate the need for constructing an intervention for reducing PSD based on 
the attributes from the HNC patient's perspective.","© 2023 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Indian Journal of Palliative

malignancy with an incidence of only 0.02-0.125%. Imaging of low-grade ductal 
carcinoma in situ within a breast fibroadenoma shows no specific presentation. 
Therefore, pathology and immunohistochemistry are required for definitive 
diagnosis. Surgery is currently considered to be an effective treatment. There 
is no uniform clinical standard for postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy.
CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old female patient underwent excisional biopsy on 
October 19, 2022. Pathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of 
low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ within the fibroadenoma. Subsequently, 
breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed under 
general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, and no cancer metastasis was 
observed in the sentinel lymph nodes or incisional margins.
CONCLUSION: Low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ within a breast fibroadenoma is 
an extremely rare malignancy, and clinicians should be familiar with its 
clinicopathological features and treatment methods. Multidisciplinary joint 
treatment is recommended to maximize the benefits to patients.",© 2023 Ni et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S413223

optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising approach for evaluating 
abnormalities in tissue. To date, a standardized measure of accuracy and 
precision of μOCT by the depth-resolved estimation (DRE) method, as an 
alternative to least squares fitting, is missing.
AIM: We present a robust theoretical framework to determine accuracy and 
precision of the DRE of μOCT.
APPROACH: We derive and validate analytical expressions for the accuracy and 
precision of μOCT determination by the DRE using simulated OCT signals in 
absence and presence of noise. We compare the theoretically achievable 
precisions of the DRE method and the least-squares fitting approach.
RESULTS: Our analytical expressions agree with the numerical simulations for 
high signal-to-noise ratios and qualitatively describe the dependence on noise 
otherwise. A commonly used simplification of the DRE method results in a 
systematic overestimation of the attenuation coefficient in the order of 
μOCT2 × Δ, where Δ is the pixel stepsize. When μOCT · |AFR| ≲ 1.8, μOCT is 
reconstructed with higher precision by the depth-resolved method compared to 
fitting over the length of an axial fitting range |AFR|.
CONCLUSIONS: We derived and validated expressions for the accuracy and precision 
of DRE of μOCT. A commonly used simplification of this method is not recommended 
as being used for OCT-attenuation reconstruction. We give a rule of thumb 
providing guidance in the choice of estimation method.",© 2023 The Authors.,"DOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.28.6.066001

AIM: We aim to introduce photoacoustic spectral analysis (PASA) method that can 
provide both the content and structure distribution of endogenous chromophores 
in biological tissues to characterize the tumor-related features for identifying 
different types of tumors.
APPROACH: Ex vivo human tissues with suspected squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 
suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and normal tissue were used in this study. 
The relative lipid and collagen contents in the TME were assessed based on the 
PASA parameters and compared with histology. Support vector machine (SVM), one 
of the simplest machine learning tools, was applied for automatic skin cancer 
type detection.
RESULTS: The PASA results showed that the lipid and collagen levels of the 
tumors were significantly lower than those of the normal tissue, and there was a 
statistical difference between SCC and BCC (p < 0.05), consistent with the 
histopathological results. The SVM-based categorization achieved diagnostic 
accuracies of 91.7% (normal), 93.3% (SCC), and 91.7% (BCC).

properties of retropropagated radiofrequency signals acquired by FibroscanTM 
(Echosens, Paris, France). Since ultrasound propagation is influenced by the 
presence of fat, CAP score was developed to quantify steatosis. The aim of this 
study was to delineate the accuracy of CAP in diagnosing hepatic steatosis, 
compared to the gold standard of liver biopsy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 150 patients underwent same-day liver biopsy 
and measurement of hepatic steatosis with Fibroscan. Only examinations with 10 
satisfactory measurements, and an inter-quartile range of less than 30% of the 
median liver stiffness values were included for data analysis. Histological 
staging was then correlated with median values and Spearman correlation 
calculated. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: For diagnosis of hepatic steatosis (HS), CAP could predict the

specificity (0.73) when the optimal cut-off value was set at 288 dB/m. CAP 
detected histological grade S3 with AUROC 0.735 (95% CI 0.618-0.851), 
sensitivity (0.71) and specificity (0.74), with a cut-off value of 330 dB/m. The 
AUROC for steatosis grade S1 was 0.741 (95% CI 0.650-0.824), with a cut-off 
value of 263 dB/m with sensitivity 0.75 and specificity 0.70. Univariate 
analysis showed a correlation between CAP and diabetes (p 0.048).
CONCLUSION: The performance of CAP to diagnose steatosis severity decreases as 
steatosis progresses. CAP is associated with diabetes but not other clinical 
factors and parameters of the metabolic syndrome.",© 2023 Atzori et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/HMER.S411619

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), yet the viral genetic factors that lead to the 
development of KS in KSHV-infected individuals have not been fully elucidated. 
Nearly, all previous analyses of KSHV genomic evolution and diversity have 
excluded the three major internal repeat regions: the two origins of lytic 
replication, internal repeats 1 and 2 (IR1 and IR2), and the latency-associated 
nuclear antigen (LANA) repeat domain (LANAr). These regions encode protein 
domains that are essential to the KSHV infection cycle but have been rarely 
sequenced due to their extended repetitive nature and high guanine and cytosine 
(GC) content. The limited data available suggest that their sequences and repeat 
lengths are more heterogeneous across individuals than in the remainder of the 
KSHV genome. To assess their diversity, the full-length IR1, IR2, and LANAr 
sequences, tagged with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), were obtained by 
Pacific Biosciences' single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT-UMI) from 
twenty-four tumors and six matching oral swabs from sixteen adults in Uganda 
with advanced KS. Intra-host single-nucleotide variation involved an average of 
0.16 per cent of base positions in the repeat regions compared to a nearly 
identical average of 0.17 per cent of base positions in the remainder of the 
genome. Tandem repeat unit (TRU) counts varied by only one from the intra-host 
consensus in a majority of individuals. Including the TRU indels, the average 
intra-host pairwise identity was 98.3 per cent for IR1, 99.6 per cent for IR2 
and 98.9 per cent for LANAr. More individuals had mismatches and variable TRU 
counts in IR1 (twelve/sixteen) than in IR2 (two/sixteen). There were no open 
reading frames in the Kaposin coding sequence inside IR2 in at least fifty-five 
of ninety-six sequences. In summary, the KSHV major internal repeats, like the 
rest of the genome in individuals with KS, have low diversity. IR1 was the most 
variable among the repeats, and no intact Kaposin reading frames were present in 
IR2 of the majority of genomes sampled.",© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.,"DOI: 10.1093/ve/vead034

regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and macrophage polarization. 
However, whether it participates in the progression of hypopharyngeal carcinoma 
by regulating the TME remains unclear. Methods: An online database was used to 
analyze clinical data. Macrophage polarization was detected using qRT-PCR and 
flow cytometry. In vivo experiments were performed using tumor-bearing nude 
mice. A co-culture system of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells and macrophages was 
used to explore the interactions between the two cell types. Results: LINC01569 
enhancement was observed in hypopharyngeal carcinoma tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs). In IL4-induced M2 macrophages, the expression of LINC01569 
increased, while LINC01569 expression declined significantly in LPS-induced M1 
macrophages. SiRNA-mediated downregulation of LINC01569 inhibits IL4-induced M2 
macrophage polarization. Using online databases and a dual-luciferase reporter, 
miR-193a-5p was confirmed as a potential downstream sponge of LINC01569. 
MiR-193a-5p expression decreased in IL4-mediated M2 macrophages, which was 
restored by LINC01569 downregulation. Additionally, LINC01569 
inhibition-mediated blocking of M2 macrophage polarization was moderately 
abolished by transfection with the miR-193a-5p inhibitor. Fatty acid desaturase 
1 (FADS1) was verified as a downstream target of miR-193a-5p, and LINC01569 
downregulation-mediated inhibition of FADS1 was blocked by miR-193a-5p mimics. 
Importantly, LINC01569 downregulation-mediated decline in M2 macrophage 
polarization was abolished by miR-193a-5p mimics, which was further reversed by 
FADS1 knockdown. Implantation of a mixture of FaDu cells and IL4-induced 
macrophages promoted tumor growth and proliferation, which were abrogated by the 
knockdown of LINC01569 in macrophages. Using an in co-culture system of FaDu 
cells and macrophages in vitro, M2 macrophage-regulated cell growth and 
apoptosis of FaDu cells were found to be mediated by the LINC01569/miR-193a-5p 
signaling axis. Conclusion: LINC01569 is highly expressed in the TAMs of 
hypopharyngeal carcinoma. LINC01569 downregulation restrains macrophages from 
polarizing toward M2 through the miR-193a-5p/FADS1 signaling axis, thereby 
helping tumor cells escape inherent immune surveillance and promoting the 
occurrence and development of hypopharyngeal carcinoma.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.83466

and treatment. In cancer research, long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) emerge as novel 
therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Cuprophosis is a new death type involving 
multiple biological processes in tumor cells. Here, we aimed to explore whether 
Cuprophosis-related lncRNAs could be used to predict prognosis, assess immune 
function, and test drug sensitivity in LUSC patients. The Cancer Genome Map 
(TCGA) was used to obtain genome and clinical data, and Cuprophosis-relevant 
genes were found in the literature. A cuproptosis-related lncRNA risk model was 
built using co-expression analysis, univariate/multivariate Cox regression, and 
LASSO analysis. The survival analysis was used to assess the model's prognostic 
value. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to 
determine whether risk score, age, gender, or clinical stages could be used as 
independent prognostic factors. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and mutation 
analysis were performed on differentially expressed mRNA between high-risk and 
low-risk groups. The (TIDE) algorithm was used to conduct immunological 
functional analysis and drug sensitivity testing. Five cuproptosis-related 
LncRNAs were identified, and the selected LncRNAs constructed a prognosis model. 
According to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the overall survival time for 
patients in the high-risk group was shorter than for those in the low-risk 
group. For LUSC patients, the risk score serves as an independent prognostic 
indicator. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially 
expressed mRNAs between the high- and low-risk groups were enriched in several 
immune-related processes. The enrichment score of differentially expressed mRNAs 
in the high-risk group is higher than that of the low-risk group in multiple 
immune function pathways, including the IFN-γ and MHC I pathways. The Tumor 
Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) test revealed that the high-risk group 
was more likely to experience immune escape. The drug sensitivity analysis 
showed that patients with low-risk ratings were likely to respond to GW441756 
and Salubrinal. In contrast, patients with higher risk scores were more 
responsive to dasatinib and Z-LLNIe CHO. The 5-Cuprophosis-related lncRNA 
signature can be used to predict prognosis, assess immune function, and test 
drug sensitivity in LUSC patients.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.82370

large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) remain controversial. This study 
aimed to analyze the similarity of clinical characteristics, survival outcomes 
and treatment modalities between advanced LCNEC and advanced small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) to provide more evidence for the study of advanced LCNEC. Methods: 
All SCLC and LCNEC patient data were obtained from the SEER database 
(2010-2019). Pearson's χ2 test was used to compare the differences in clinical 
characteristics. Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to balance the 
bias of the variables between patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic 
factors. KM analysis was used to calculate survival. Results: A total of 1094 
patients with IV LCNEC and 20939 patients with IV SCLC were included in this 
study. The demographic characteristics and tumor characteristics of IV LCNEC and 
IV SCLC were different (p < 0.05). After PSM, the overall survival (OS) for IV 
LCNEC and IV SCLC was 6.0 months, the cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 7.0 
months, and there was no significant difference in OS or CSS between the two 
groups. Risk/protective factors for OS and CSS were similar for IV LCNEC and IV 
SCLC patients. Survival outcomes were similar in patients with IV LCNEC and IV 
SCLC with different treatment modalities; chemoradiotherapy significantly 
improved OS and CSS in patients with IV LCNEC (9.0 months) and SCLC (10.0 
months), however, radiotherapy alone did not improve survival in patients with 
IV LCNEC. Conclusions: These results confirmed that the prognosis and treatment 
modalities are similar and that advanced LCNEC could be treated as advanced 
SCLC, which provide new evidence for the treatment of advanced LCNEC patients.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.84600

There is always a diagnostic issue with this imaging finding. Based on the size 
we can use a variety of imaging and diagnostic techniques. Moreover; in the case 
of primary lung cancer or metastasis we can use radiofrequency ablation 
endobronchially. Patients and Methods: We used the radial-endobronchial 
ultrasound with C-arm and Archemedes, Bronchus electromagnetic navigation in 
order to acquire biopsy sample and we also used rapid on-site evaluation as a 
rapid diagnosis for pulmonary nodules. After rapid diagnosis we used the 
radiofrequency ablation catheter in order to ablate central pulmonary nodules. 
Results: Both techniques provide efficient navigation, however, with the 
Bronchus system less time is needed. The new radiofrequency ablation catheter 
provides efficient results in central lesions with low watts ≤40. Conclusion: We 
provided in our research a protocol to diagnose and treat such lesions. Future

patients was increasing but their prognoses were poor. Blood-based predictive 
biomarkers were associated with prognosis. This study was to build a nomogram 
based on preoperative clinical laboratory blood biomarkers for predicting 
prognosis in curatively resected EJA. Methods: Curatively resected EJA patients, 
recruited between 2003 and 2017 in the Cancer Hospital of Shantou University 
Medical College, were divided chronologically into the training (n=465) and 
validation groups (n=289). Fifty markers, involving sociodemographic 
characteristics and preoperative clinical laboratory blood indicators, were 
screened for nomogram construction. Independent predictive factors were selected 
using Cox regression analysis and then were combined to build a nomogram to 
predict overall survival (OS). Results: Composed of 12 factors, including age, 
body mass index, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine transaminase 
ratio, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, uric acid, IgA, IgG, complement C3, 
complement factor B and systemic immune-inflammation index, we constructed a 
novel nomogram for OS prediction. In the training group, when combined with TNM 
system, it acquired a C-index of 0.71, better than using TNM system only 
(C-index: 0.62, p < 0.001). When applied in the validation group, the combined 
C-index was 0.70, also better than using TNM system (C-index: 0.62, p < 0.001). 
Calibration curves exhibited that the nomogram-predicted probabilities of 5-year 
OS were both in consistency with the actual 5-year OS in both groups. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis exhibited that patients with higher nomogram scores 
contained poorer 5-year OS than those with lower scores (p < 0.0001). 
Conclusions: In conclusion, the novel nomogram built based on preoperative blood 
indicators might be the potential prognosis prediction model of curatively 
resected EJA.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.83588

advanced driver-negative NSCLC, but its true efficacy remains unclear. In 
addition, chemotherapy tolerance in elderly NSCLC patients is poor, and the 
precise identification of the population that may benefit from ICIs combined 
with angiogenesis inhibitors is also the focus of current research. Methods: We 
retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety of ICIs combined with or 
without antiangiogenic agents in elderly patients with advanced driver-gene 
negative NSCLC ≥65 years of age in the Cancer Center of Suzhou Hospital 
Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University. The primary endpoint was PFS. 
Secondary endpoints were OS, ORR, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). 
Results: A total of 36 patients in the IA group (immune checkpoint inhibitors 
plus angiogenesis inhibitors group) and 43 patients in the NIA group (immune 
checkpoint inhibitors without angiogenesis inhibitors group) were enrolled in 
the study between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2021. The median follow-up 
time for patients in the IA group and NIA group was 18.2 months (95%CI: 14 - 
22.5 months) and 21.4 months (95%CI: 16.7 -26.1 months), respectively. The 
median PFS and median OS were longer in the IA group compared to the NIA group

30.9 months; HR for OS: 0.795, 95%CI: 0.396-1.595, P=0.519). There were no 
significant differences in median PFS and median OS between the two groups. 
Subgroup analysis showed that patients in the IA group had significantly longer 
PFS in the subgroup with PD-L1 expression ≥50% (P=0.017), and the association 
between different groups and disease progression was still different in the two 
subgroups (P for interaction = 0.002). There was no significant difference in 
ORR between the two groups (23.3% vs 30.5%, P=0.465). The incidence of irAEs in 
the IA group was lower than that in the NIA group (39.5% vs 19.4%, P=0.05), and

significantly reduced (P=0.045). Conclusion: In elderly patients with advanced 
driver-negative NSCLC, the addition of antiangiogenic agents to ICIs therapy did 
not provide significant clinical benefit, but the incidence of irAEs and 
treatment interruptions due to irAEs was significantly reduced. In the subgroup 
analysis, we found that the clinical benefit of this combination therapy was

malignancy of the head and neck. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the 
development of HNSCC have not been fully elucidated. Materials and Methods: 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) and GSE23036 datasets. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis 
(WGCNA) was used to reveal the correlations among genes and to search for 
significantly correlated gene modules. The expression levels of genes in HNSCC 
and normal samples according to antibody-based detected methods was assessed by 
utilizing the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). The impact of the selected hub genes on 
the prognosis of HNSCC patients was assessed by analysing immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) expression levels and clinical data. Results: 
Twenty-four genes positively correlated with tumour status and 15 genes 
negatively correlated with tumour status were screened out by WGCNA. PLAU and 
LAMC2 were associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC and were 
finally screened out and verified by GEPIA and HPA database analysis. 
Immunohistochemistry of samples collected from 175 patients with HNSCC and 
subsequent statistical analysis also showed that PLAU and LAMC2 were associated 
with a poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC, and the levels of these two 
factors were positively correlated. The expression and co-localization of PLAU 
and LAMC2 in HNSCC tissues were confirmed by double immunofluorescence labeling. 
Conclusions: There was a positive correlation between PLAU and LAMC2 expression 
in HNSCC samples, and PLAU and LAMC2 might be independent prognostic biomarkers 
for HNSCC.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.84407

years, EOGA) is rising. Tumors in younger patients are associated with 
prognostically unfavorable features. The impact of EOGA on patient survival, 
however, remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate early-onset age 
as a prognostic factor compared to late-onset gastric adenocarcinoma (LOGA, 
>50years) in a surgical cohort and assess treatment options. Methods: We 
analyzed 738 patients (129 early-onset/609 late-onset) operated in curative 
intent from 2002 to 2021. Data was extracted from a prospectively managed 
database of an academic tertiary referral hospital. Differences in perioperative 
as well as oncological outcomes were calculated by chi-square test. Cox 
regression analysis was performed to assess disease-free survival (DFS) and 
overall survival (OS). Results: EOGA patients were more often treated with 
neoadjuvant therapy (62.8% vs. 43.7%, p<0.001) and extended surgical resections 
e.g. through additional resections (36.4% vs. 26.8%, p=0.027). EOGA was more 
often metastasized into regional lymph nodes (pN+ 67.4% vs. 55.3%, p=0.012) and 
to distant sites (pM+: 23.3% vs. 12.0%, p=0.001) and was more often poorly 
differentiated (G3/G4: 91.1% vs. 67.2%, p<0.001). There were no significant 
differences in overall complication rates (31.0% vs. 36.6%, p=0.227). Survival 
analysis showed shorter DFS (median DFS 25.6 months vs. not reached, p=0.006) 
but similar OS (median OS: 50.5 months vs. not reached, p=0.920) in EOGA 
compared to LOGA. Conclusions: This analysis confirmed that EOGA is associated 
with more aggressive tumor characteristics. Early-Onset was not a prognostic 
factor in the multivariate analysis. EOGA patients may be more capable to 
undergo intensive multimodal therapy including perioperative chemotherapy and 
extended surgery.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.82876

sequencing data of the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colon adenocarcinoma 
(COAD) cohort. Methods: There were 438 COAD patients were fit into current study 
for survival analysis. Gene expression profiling interactive analysis 2.0, 
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery v6.8, gene set 
enrichment analysis (GSEA) and connectivity map (CMap) are used to investigate 
the molecular mechanisms and targeted drugs of STXBP5-AS1 in COAD. Results: By 
comparing the expression level of tumor and non-tumor tissues, we found that 
STXBP5-AS1 was notablely down-regulated in COAD tumor tissues. Survival analysis 
suggested that low STXBP5-AS1 expression was significantly related to poor 
overall survival (OS) of COAD (log-rank P=0.035, adjusted P=0.005, HR=0.545, 
95%CI=0.356-0.836). The enrichment analysis of STXBP5-AS1 co-expressed genes, 
GSEA and differentially expressed genes suggests that STXBP5-AS1 may play a part 
in COAD by regulating the following biological processes or pathways: cell 
junction, DNA replication, apoptosis, cell cycle, metastasis, tumor protein 53, 
Wnt, mTORC1, MCM, notch receptor 4, transforming growth factor beta receptor, 
and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. CMap analysis was screened out four small 
molecule drugs (anisomycin, cephaeline, NU-1025 and quipazine) that may be used 
as STXBP5-AS1 targeted therapy drugs in COAD. The co-expression analysis of 
STXBP5-AS1 and immune cell gene signature indicated that STXBP5-AS1 was 
significantly related to immune cell gene set in normal intestinal tissues, but 
not in COAD tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results revealed that STXBP5-AS1 is 
notablely down-regulated in COAD tumor tissues, and may act as a novel 
prognostic biomarker for COAD.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.83423

suggesting an aggressive subtype of thyroid cancer and poor prognosis. 
Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor of BRAFV600E, may provide therapeutic benefit 
in various cancers including thyroid cancer. However, the prevalence of drug 
resistance remains a challenge because of the feedback activation of the 
MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. In treating thyroid cancer cells with 
vemurafenib, we have detected reactivation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway as 
a result of the release of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) from the 
negative feedback of ERK phosphorylation. SHP2 is an important target protein 
downstream of the RTK signaling pathway. Decreasing it through SHP2 knockdown or 
the use of an inhibitor of SHP2 (SHP099) was found to significantly increase the 
early sensitivity and reverse the late resistance to vemurafenib in BRAFV600E 
mutant thyroid cancer cells. Overall, our findings suggest that blocking SHP2 
reverses the reactivation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway caused by the 
activation of RTKs and improves the sensitivity of thyroid cancer to 
vemurafenib, which has potential implications for mechanism-based early 
combination strategies to treat thyroid cancer.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.83853

oral bacteria linked to CRC including Porphyromonas gingivalis. Few studies have 
however analysed the implications of this bacterium in CRC progression and 
survival. In this study, we investigated the intestinal presence of P. 
gingivalis by qPCR in both faecal and mucosal samples from two different patient

significantly different levels of P. gingivalis were found in faeces of CRC 
patients compared to controls (P = 0.028). Furthermore, an association was found 
between the presence of P. gingivalis in faeces and tumour tissue (P < 0.001). 
Our findings further suggested a potential link between mucosal P. gingivalis

P. gingivalis were found to have a significantly decreased cancer-specific 
survival (P = 0.040). In conclusion, P. gingivalis could be linked to patients

elements (TEs) homeostasis was closely associated with the occurrence of 
colorectal cancer (CRC), the clinical value of TEs in CRC with different 
molecular subtypes was largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the 
correlation between KRAS mutations/MSI status and serum TEs levels in patients 
with CRC. Methods: The serum concentrations of 18 TEs were detected by 
inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-MS). MSI status (two 
mononucleotides: BAT25, BAT26, three dinucleotides: D2S123, D5S346, and 
D17S250), KRAS (G516T, G517A, G518C, G520T, G521A, G522C, and G532A) mutations 
were detected by the multiplex fluorescent PCR and the real-time fluorescent 
quantitative PCR, respectively. The correlations among KRAS mutations/MSI 
status, demographic and clinical characteristics, and TEs were analyzed by 
Spearman correlation analysis. Results: The propensity score matching (PSM) 
analysis was adopted to minimize differences between groups. Before PSM, 204 CRC 
patients were recruited in this study, including 123 KRAS-negative patients and 
81 KRAS-positive patients according to the test results of KRAS mutations, and 
165 MSS patients and 39 MSI patients based on MSI detection. After PSM, the 
serum concentration of Mn was significantly lower in CRC patients with KRAS 
mutations than those without KRAS mutations, and a significant negative 
correlation was observed between Mn and Pb in the KRAS-positive cases. CRC 
patients carrying MSI had a significantly lower level of Rb compared to MSS 
patients. Importantly, Rb was significantly positively correlated with Fe, Mn, 
Se, and Zn in patients with MSI. Collectively, all our data indicated that the 
occurrence of different molecular events might be accompanied by different 
alterations in types and levels of serum TEs. Conclusions: CRC patients with 
different molecular subtypes presented different alterations in types and levels 
of serum TEs. Mn was significantly negatively correlated with the KRAS 
mutations, and Rb was noticeably negatively correlated with the MSI status, 
indicating certain TEs might contribute to the pathogenesis of molecular

cohorts were enrolled in the study, and BM-related differentially expressed 
genes (BM-DEGs) were screened using weighted gene coexpression network analysis

using Cox regression analysis and separated patients into two groups based on 
the median risk score. This signature was validated with in vitro experiments, 
and its mechanism was investigated by enrichment and tumour microenvironment 
analyses. We also evaluated whether this signature could predict sensitivity to 
chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was 
utilized to analyse the expression of signature genes in different cells. 
Results: Thirsty-seven BM-DEGs were discovered, and a prognostic signature based 
on 4 BM-DEGs (HMCN2, FBLN5, ADAMTS15 and LAD1) was obtained in the TCGA cohort 
and validated in GEO cohorts. Survival curves and ROC curve analysis 
demonstrated that the risk score was a significant predictor of survival in all 
cohorts even when considering the effect of other clinical indexes. Low-risk 
patients had longer survival times, higher immune cell infiltration levels and

carcinoma (CRC) has not yet been elucidated. This study is aimed to illustrate 
the indispensable role of proline-rich acidic protein 1 (PRAP1) in 
cisplatin-resistant CRC. Methods: Cell viability and apoptosis were monitored 
using cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence and 
morphological analysis were used to determine mitotic arrest in cells. In vivo 
drug resistance was evaluated using a tumor xenograft assay. Results: PRAP1 was 
highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant CRC. PRAP1-upregulation in HCT-116 cells 
increased chemoresistance to cisplatin, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of PRAP1 
sensitized cisplatin-resistant HCT-116 cells (HCT-116/DDP) to cisplatin. 
PRAP1-upregulation in HCT-116 cells hindered mitotic arrest and the formation of 
mitotic checkpoint complexes (MCC), followed by an increase in 
multidrug-resistant proteins such as p-glycoprotein 1 and multidrug 
resistance-associated protein 1, while PRAP1-knockdown in HCT-116/DDP cells 
partly restored colcemid-induced mitotic arrest and MCC assembly, resulting in 
decreased multidrug-resistant protein levels. PRAP1 downregulation-mediated 
sensitization to cisplatin in HCT-116/DDP cells was abolished by the inhibition 
of mitotic kinase activity by limiting MCC assembly. Additionally, 
PRAP1-upregulation increased cisplatin-resistance in CRC in vivo. 
Mechanistically, PRAP1 increased the expression of mitotic arrest deficient 1 
(MAD1), that competitively binds to mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2) in 
cisplatin-resistant CRC cells, leading to failed assembly of MCC and subsequent 
chemotherapy resistance. Conclusion: PRAP1-overexpression caused cisplatin 
resistance in CRC. Possibly, PRAP1 induced an increase in MAD1, which 
competitively interacted with MAD2 and subsequently restrained the formation of 
MCC, resulting in CRC cells escape from the supervision of MCC and chemotherapy 
resistance.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/jca.84048

to improve therapeutic success and thereby the survival of patients. In the case 
of melanoma, the constitutively active MAPK pathway is targeted by a 
combinatorial inhibition of BRAF and MEK activities. These MAPK pathway players 
may display patient-specific differences in the onco-kinase mutation spectrum, 
which needs to be considered for the design of more efficient personalized 
therapies. Here, we extend a bioluminescence-based kinase conformation biosensor 
(KinCon) to allow for live-cell tracking of interconnected kinase activity 
states. First, we show that common MEK1 patient mutations promote a structural 
rearrangement of the kinase to an opened and active conformation. This effect 
was reversible by the binding of MEK inhibitors to mutated MEK1, as shown in 
biosensor assays and molecular dynamics simulations. Second, we implement a 
novel application of the KinCon technology for tracking the simultaneous, 
vertical targeting of the two functionally linked kinases BRAF and MEK1. Thus, 
we demonstrate that, in the presence of constitutively active BRAF-V600E, 
specific inhibitors of both kinases are efficient in driving MEK1 into a closed, 
inactive conformation state. We compare current melanoma treatments and show 
that combinations of BRAFi and MEKi display a more pronounced structural change 
of the drug sensor than the respective single agents, thereby identifying 
synergistic effects among these drug combinations. In summary, we depict the 
extension of the KinCon biosensor technology to systematically validate, 
anticipate, and personalize tailored drug arrangements using a multiplexed 
setup.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of National

clinical manifestation of a broad spectrum of conditions in the GI tract. 
According to its clinical presentation, GI bleeding can be classified into 
overt, occult, and obscure types. Additionally, it can be divided into upper and 
lower GI bleeding based on the Treitz ligament. Variable disease entities, 
including vascular lesions, polyps, neoplasms, inflammation such as Crohn's 
disease, and heterotopic pancreatic or gastric tissue, can cause GI bleeding. CT 
and conventional angiographies and nuclear scintigraphy are all radiologic 
imaging modalities that can be used to evaluate overt bleeding. For the work-up 
of occult GI bleeding, CT enterography (CTE) can be the first imaging modality. 
For CTE, an adequate bowel distention is critical for obtaining acceptable 
diagnostic performance as well as minimizing false positives and negatives. 
Meckel's scintigraphy can be complementarily useful in cases where the diagnosis 
of CTE is suboptimal. For the evaluation of obscured GI bleeding, various 
imaging modalities can be used based on clinical status and providers' 
preferences.","위장관 출혈은 단일 질환이 아니라 광범위한 위장 질환의 증상 및 임상적 발현이다. 임상적 양상에 따라 명백한 출혈, 잠재 출혈, 원인 불명

examined the role of SLC5A3, a myo-inositol transporter, in the pathogenesis of

levels were upregulated in cervical cancer tissues. The upregulated SLC5A3 mRNA 
levels were negatively correlated with survival and progression-free interval. 
Genes co-expressed with SLC5A3 were enriched in multiple signaling cascades 
involved in cancer progression. In primary/established cervical cancer cells, 
SLC5A3 shRNA/knockout (KO) exerted growth-inhibitory effects and promoted cell 
death/apoptosis. Furthermore, SLC5A3 knockdown or KO downregulated myo-inositol 
levels, induced oxidative injury, and decreased Akt-mTOR activation in cervical 
cancer cells. In contrast, supplementation of myo-inositol or 
n-acetyl-L-cysteine or transduction of a constitutively active Akt1 construct 
mitigated SLC5A3 KO-induced cytotoxicity in cervical cancer cells. Lentiviral 
SLC5A3 overexpression construct transduction upregulated the cellular 
myo-inositol level and promoted Akt-mTOR activation, enhancing cervical cancer 
cell proliferation and migration. The binding of TonEBP to the SLC5A3 promoter

growth in mice. SLC5A3 KO also inhibited pCCa-1 cervical cancer xenograft 
growth. The SLC5A3-depleted xenograft tissues exhibited myo-inositol 
downregulation, Akt-mTOR inactivation, and oxidative injury. Transduction of 
sh-TonEBP AAV construct downregulated SLC5A3 expression and inhibited pCCa-1

were taken up by antigen-presenting cells, which enhanced the CpG-272-promoted T 
cell-mediated tumor-killing effect. These form a positive feed-forward antitumor 
effect between the actions of CpG-2722 and BPRDP056. Thus, the study findings

cancer patients, both of which still lack effective therapeutics. ROS1 
inhibition results in synthetic lethality in CDH1-deficient cancers, but often 
leads to adaptive resistance. Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of the FAK 
activity accompanies the emergence of resistance to ROS1 inhibitor therapy in 
gastric and breast CDH1-deficient cancers. FAK inhibition, either by FAK 
inhibitors or by knocking down its expression, resulted in higher cytotoxicity 
potency of the ROS1 inhibitor in CDH1-deficient cancer cell lines. Co-treatment 
of mice with the FAK inhibitor and ROS1 inhibitors also showed synergistic 
effects against CDH1-deficient cancers. Mechanistically, ROS1 inhibitors induce 
the FAK-YAP-TRX signaling, decreasing oxidative stress-related DNA damage and 
consequently reducing their anti-cancer effects. The FAK inhibitor suppresses 
the aberrant FAK-YAP-TRX signaling, reinforcing ROS1 inhibitor's cytotoxicity 
towards cancer cells. These findings support the use of FAK and ROS1 inhibitors 
as a combination therapeutic strategy in CDH1-deficient triple negative breast

resistance which lead to poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, 
little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating tumor cell dormancy 
and how to eliminate dormant cancer cells. Recent studies indicate autophagy 
affects dormant tumor cell survival. Here, we found that polo-like kinases 4 
(PLK4), a central regulator of the cell cycle and proliferation, plays a crucial 
role in regulating CRC cells dormancy both in vitro and in vivo. Downregulation 
of PLK4 induced dormancy and inhibited migration and invasion in different CRC 
cell lines. Clinically, PLK4 expression was correlated with the dormancy markers 
(Ki67, p-ERK, p-p38) and late recurrence in CRC tissues. Mechanistically, 
downregulation of PLK4 induced autophagy contributed to restoring phenotypically 
aggressive tumor cells to a dormant state through the MAPK signaling pathway, 
and inhibition of autophagy would trigger apoptosis of dormant cells. Our 
findings reveal that downregulation of PLK4-induced autophagy contributes to 
tumor dormancy and autophagy inhibition leads to apoptosis of CRC dormant cells. 
Our study is the first to report that downregulation PLK4 induced autophagy is 
an early event in CRC dormancy and highlights autophagy inhibitor as a potential 
therapeutic target for dormant cell elimination.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/ijbs.79949

mucin-based antineoplastic therapy. However, little is known about circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) on regulating mucins. Dysregulated mucins and circRNAs were 
identified via high-throughput sequencing and their relationships with lung 
cancer survival were analyzed in tumor samples of 141 patients. The biological 
functions of circRABL2B were determined via gain- and loss-of-function 
experiments and exosome-packaged circRABL2B treatment in cells, patient-derived 
lung cancer organoids and nude mice. We identified that circRABL2B was 
negatively correlated with MUC5AC. Patients with low circRABL2B and high MUC5AC 
displayed the poorest survival (HR=2.00; 95% CI=1.12-3.57). Overexpressed 
circRABL2B significantly inhibited cell malignant phenotypes, while it 
knock-down exerted opposite effects. CircRABL2B interacted with YBX1 to inhibit 
MUC5AC, and subsequently suppressed integrin β4/pSrc/p53 signaling and 
impoverished cell stemness, and promoted erlotinib sensitivity. Exosome-packaged 
circRABL2B exerted significant anti-cancer actions in cells, patient-derived 
lung cancer organoids and nude mice. Meanwhile, circRABL2B in plasma exosomes 
could distinguish early-stage lung cancer patients from healthy controls. 
Finally, we found circRABL2B was downregulated at the transcriptional level, and 
EIF4a3 involved the formation of circRABL2B. In conclusion, our data suggest 
that circRABL2B counteracts lung cancer progression via MUC5AC/integrin

prognosis. Gemcitabine (GEM)-based chemotherapy is the first-line chemotherapy 
for advanced CCA but has a response rate of only 20-30%. Therefore, 
investigating treatments to overcome GEM resistance in advanced CCA is crucial. 
Among mucin (MUC) family members, MUC4 showed the greatest increase in the 
resistant versus parental sublines. MUC4 was upregulated in whole-cell lysates 
and conditioned media from gemcitabine-resistant (GR) CCA sublines. MUC4 
mediated GEM resistance by activating AKT signaling in GR CCA cells. The 
MUC4-AKT axis induced BAX S184 phosphorylation to inhibit apoptosis and 
downregulated GEM transporter human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 
(hENT1) expression. The combination of AKT inhibitors and GEM or afatinib 
overcame GEM resistance in CCA. In vivo, capivasertib (an AKT inhibitor) 
increased GEM sensitivity in GR cells. MUC4 promoted EGFR and HER2 activation to 
mediate GEM resistance. Finally, MUC4 expression in patient plasma correlated 
with MUC4 expression. Paraffin-embedded specimens from non-responders expressed 
significantly more MUC4 than did those from responders, and this upregulation 
was associated with poor progression-free survival and overall survival. In GR 
CCA, high MUC4 expression promotes sustained EGFR/HER2 signaling and AKT 
activation. The combination of AKT inhibitors with GEM or afatinib might

CYP51, and EBP are promising therapeutic targets for drug development due to 
many drugs have been approved and entered into clinical research by targeting 
these genes. However, new targets and drugs still need to be discovered. 
Interestingly, many small nucleic acid drugs and vaccines were approved for the

Nusinersen, Volanesorsen, Eteplirsen, Golodirsen, Viltolarsen, Casimersen, 
Elasomeran, Tozinameran. However, these agents are all linear RNA agents. 
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) may have longer half-lives, higher stability, lower 
immunogenicity, lower production costs, and higher delivery efficiency than 
these agents due to their covalently closed structures. CircRNA agents are 
developed by several companies, including Orna Therapeutics, Laronde, and 
CirCode, Therorna. Many studies have shown that circRNAs regulate cholesterol 
synthesis by regulating HMGCR, SQLE, HMGCS1, ACS, YWHAG, PTEN, DHCR24, SREBP-2, 
and PMK expression. MiRNAs are essential for circRNA-mediated cholesterol 
biosynthesis. Notable, the phase II trial for inhibiting miR-122 with nucleic 
acid drugs has been completed. Suppressing HMGCR, SQLE, and miR-122 with 
circRNA_ABCA1, circ-PRKCH, circEZH2, circRNA-SCAP, and circFOXO3 are the 
promising therapeutic target for drug development, specifically the circFOXO3.

food. This study aimed at determining the level of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in 
hen eggs and at assessing the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks caused by 
the consumption of hen eggs collected in Iran. A total of 42 hen eggs from 17 
major brands were randomly sampled from supermarkets. Lead and cadmium 
concentrations were determined by using inductively coupled plasma mass 
spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additionally, using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) 
method to calculate dietary exposure, target hazard quotient (THQ), and 
incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), the related human health risk 
associated with ingesting these hazardous metals for adults was evaluated. The 
average Pb and Cd concentrations in whole eggs were 7.16 ± 0.248, and 
2.83 ± 0.151 μg kg-1, respectively, which were less than the maximum permitted 
levels, established by FAO/WHO and the Institute of Standards and Industrial 
Research of Iran (ISIRI). Pb and Cd concentrations were significantly correlated 
at the 0.05 level (r = 0.350). Regarding the levels of Pb and Cd in eggs, 
overall, the estimated weekly intake (EWI) of these metals for adults by egg 
consumption was determined 0.014 and 0.007 mg/week, respectively, which were 
lower than the risk values suggested. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic 
indexes of Cd and Pb indicated that the adult population in Iran was safe (THQ 
Pb and Cd <1, ILCR <10-6 Pb). It should be emphasized that this research 
primarily focuses on egg consumption, which may account for a relatively small 
portion of Iranian consumers' overall exposure to Pb and Cd. Therefore, a 
comprehensive study on the risk assessment of these metals through whole-diet 
foods is recommended. The findings showed that lead and cadmium levels in all 
evaluated eggs were suitable for human consumption. Adults' Pb and Cd exposure 
from eating eggs was significantly lower than the risk levels established by 
Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), per the exposure 
assessment. According to the THQ values of these dangerous metals, which were 
below one value, egg eating by Iranian consumers does not present a 
non-carcinogenic risk. In addition, this finding provides accurate and reliable 
information for policymakers to improve food safety status to reduce public 
health hazards.","© 2023 National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute (NNFTRI),

research was to assess non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) in 
some dairy products (yogurt, doogh, and kashk) using modified QuEChERS (Quick, 
Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) technique and gas 
chromatography-triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QqQ-MS/MS) method and 
risk assessment study. The LOQs (limit of quantifications), LODs (limit of

0.06-0.12 ng/g fat, 97.45-102.63%, and 6.33-8.86%, respectively. The results 
revealed that the mean concentrations of Ʃ6-NDL-PCBs in samples were 
15.17 ± 3.44 ng/g fat, which was lower than the standard level established by 
European Union (EU, 40 ng/g fat). The maximum mean level was PCB 180 
(9.98 ± 2.04 ng/g fat) and the minimum mean level of PCBs in samples was PCB 28 
(0.09 ± 0.06 ng/g fat). Also, results showed that kashk samples had a maximum 
mean level of 6-NDL-PCBs (18.66 ± 2.42 ng/g fat) and doogh samples had a minimum 
mean level of 6-NDL-PCBs (12.21 ± 2.22 ng/g fat). The mean level of 6-NDL-PCBs 
in yogurt samples was 14.65 ± 2.02 ng/g fat. The heat map results showed the 
correlation between the spectral indices of 6-NDL-PCBs in different dairy 
products. According to the Monte Carlo method, risk assessment was done using 
calculating the Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) and Incremental Life Cancer Risk 
(ILCR). The EDI values of 6 NDL-PCBs based on the 95th percentile in yogurt, 
doogh, and kashk were 14.3, 1.49, and 0.5 ng/kg.day, respectively. Considering 
that the contaminant level in the samples is lower than the EU limit, it can be 
concluded that dietary exposure to 6 NDL-PCBs may not pose a risk to the health 
of consumers.","© 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Food Science & Nutrition published

abundantly present in medicinal plants and have remarkable therapeutic 
potential. Oxidative stress and antibiotic resistance are major causes of 
present-day ailments such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular 
disorders, cancer, and inflammation. The data for this review were collected 
from Google Scholar, PubMed, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and 
Science Direct by using keywords: ""Medicinal plants, Phytobioactive compounds, 
Polyphenols, Alkaloids, Carotenoids etc."" Several studies have reported the 
pharmacological and therapeutic potential of the phytobioactives. Polyphenols,

remarkable antioxidant, anticancer, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, 
cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and 
antidiabetic activities. This literature review was planned to provide 
comprehensive insight into the biopharmacological and therapeutic potential of 
phytobioactive compounds. The techniques used for the extraction and isolation 
of phytobioactive compounds, and bioassays required for their biological 
activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic 
activities, have been discussed. Characterization techniques for the structural 
elucidation of phytobioactive compounds such as HPLC, TLC, FTIR, GC-MS/MS, and 
NMR have also been discussed. This review concludes that phytobioactive 
compounds may be used as potential alternative to synthetic compounds as 
therapeutic agents for the treatment of various diseases.",© 2023 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/fsn3.3308

leading to death in lethal doses. This study developed a novel high-pressure 
acidified steaming (HPAS) for detoxification of mycotoxins in foods and feed. 
The raw materials, maize and peanut/groundnut, were used for the study. The 
samples were separated into raw and processed categories. Processed samples were 
treated using HPAS at different citric acid concentrations (CCC) adjusted to 
pH 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit method 
for mycotoxins analysis was used to determine the levels of mycotoxins in the 
grains, with specific focus on total aflatoxins (AT), aflatoxins B1 (AFB1), 
aflatoxin G1 (AFG1), ochratoxin A (OTA), and citrinin. The mean values of the 
AT, AFB1, AFG1, OTA, and citrinin in the raw samples were 10.06 ± 0.02, 
8.21 ± 0.01, 6.79 ± 0.00, 8.11 ± 0.02, and 7.39 ± 0.01 μg/kg for maize, 
respectively (p ≤ .05); and for groundnut (peanut), they were 8.11 ± 0.01, 
4.88 ± 0.01, 7.04 ± 0.02, 6.75 ± 0.01, and 4.71 ± 0.00 μg/kg, respectively. At 
CCC adjusted to pH 5.0, the AT, AFB1, AFG1, OTA, and citrinin in the samples 
significantly reduced by 30%-51% and 17%-38% for maize and groundnut, 
respectively, and were reduced to 28%-100% when CCC was adjusted to pH 4.5 and 
4.0 (p ≤ .05). The HPAS process either completely detoxified the mycotoxins or 
at least reduced them to levels below the maximum limits of 4.00-6.00, 2.00, 
2.00, 5.00, and 100 μg/kg for AT, AFB1, AFG1, OTA, and citrinin, respectively, 
set by the European Union, WHO/FAO, and USDA. The study clearly demonstrates 
that mycotoxins can be completely detoxified using HPAS at CCC adjusted to 
pH 4.0 or below. This can be widely applied or integrated into many agricultural 
and production processes in the food, pharmaceutical, medical, chemical, and 
nutraceutical industries where pressurized steaming can be applied for the 
successful detoxification of mycotoxins.",© 2023 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/fsn3.3324

diseases to liver cirrhosis and even liver cancer, it is also an important link 
affecting prognosis. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the therapeutic 
effect of anthocyanins on liver fibrosis and the molecular mechanism of 
mmu_circ_0000623 in anthocyanin therapy. In this study, CCL4 was used to build a 
mouse liver fibrosis model, and the treatment groups were treated with 100 and 
200 mg/kg of anthocyanins daily by gavage. Liver fibrosis indicators, macrophage 
polarization markers, and liver injury markers were further detected by 
real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting (WB), and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. Morphological verification of liver injury in different 
treatment groups was performed by histopathological method. A mouse hepatic 
stellate cell (HSC) model and a mouse liver fibrosis model were constructed to 
verify the expression of circ_0000623, miR-351-5p, and TFEB. Transfected with 
mRFP-GFP-LC3 to detect the autophagic flux of HSCs. We found that 100 mg/kg or 
200 mg/kg of anthocyanins could significantly reduce the degree of liver 
fibrosis in mice. In addition, anthocyanins can inhibit the proliferation, 
activation, and migration ability of HSCs. circ_0000623 was lowly expressed in 
mice with liver fibrosis, and anthocyanin treatment could promote its increased 
expression. Further testing found that anthocyanins could reverse the blocked 
autophagic flux induced by PDGF or CCL4. This effect is achieved by regulating 
the expression of TFEB by competitive adsorption of miR-351-5p. Anthocyanins 
could treat liver fibrosis by modulating circ_0000623/miR-351-5p/TFEB-mediated

responses are frequently observed following trauma. Numerous dietary agents have 
long been found to have potential in modulating inflammatory responses. This 
pilot study, designed an enteral formula with low inflammatory properties based 
on the dietary inflammatory index (DII®) and evaluated its effect on 
inflammatory and metabolic factors in critically ill TBI patients. This 
single-blind randomized controlled pilot study was conducted at the 
Neurosurgical ICU of Shahid Kamyab Hospital (Mashhad, Iran). A total of 20 TBI 
patients were randomly assigned to receive either low-DII score or standard

included clinical status, inflammatory biomarkers, APACHE II, SAPS II, SOFA, and 
NUTRIC scores. The trial groups did not differ significantly in baseline values. 
Following 14 days of intervention, there was a statistically significant 
decrease in the APACHE II, SAPS II, and NUTRIC scores and a significant increase 
in the GCS score in the low-DII score formula group compared to the standard 
formula group. Over 2 weeks, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) values 
of -2.73 (95% CI: -3.67, -1.79) mg/dL in the low-DII score formula group versus 
0.65 (95% CI: -0.29, 1.58) mg/dL in controls were obtained. Moreover, the length 
of hospital stay was longer for the standard formula group than for the low-DII

inconsistency among the results of previous studies. Therefore, this study is 
aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of

characterized by chronic liver damage mediated by the imbalance between 
extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation. If the injury factor cannot be 
removed for a long time, fibrosis will progress to cirrhosis or even cancer. The 
development of liver fibrosis is a very complex process which is related to the 
activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), oxidative stress, and cytokines 
produced by immune cells. At present, screening of substances with 
anti-inflammatory activity from natural plant extracts has become a new research 
focus in the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis. Mulberry twig is a 
commonly used traditional Chinese medicine. Pharmacological studies have shown 
that mulberry twig has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Thus, it is 
likely that Mulberry twig contains active substances with liver protection 
functions. The present study aimed to explore the effect of Mulberroside A 
(MulA), the main active ingredient from Mulberry twig, on acute liver injury 
induced by CCl4 in mice. MulA treatment could significantly alleviate the 
CCl4-induced liver injury, as evidenced by histological analysis and Masson 
staining. However, we observed that MulA inhibited the expressions of collagen I 
and α-SMA in livers of CCl4-treated mice but did not directly inhibit the 
proliferation and activation of HSCs. Finally, we analyzed the anti-inflammatory 
effect of MulA and demonstrated that it could markedly inhibit the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines release in liver tissues and in cultured macrophages, 
thereby alleviating liver fibrosis. Our findings suggest MulA as a potential 
therapeutic candidate for liver injury and inflammatory diseases.",© 2023 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/fsn3.3333

in elderly men with nocturia, urgency, lower urinary tract obstruction and 
normal PSA.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a case of a 56-years-old patient who presented 
at the emergency ward with weight loss, nausea and vomiting. The diagnostic 
evaluation showed acute renal failure due to a bladder tumor. After admission to 
the urology ward and subsequent contrast-enhanced CT urography and 
contrast-enhanced chest CT, a non-metastatic bladder tumor that infiltrated the 
right side of the bladder and seminal vesicles was found. High-grade 
muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma was diagnosed from TURBT specimens, 
followed by radical cystoprostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and formation 
of ureterocutaneostomy sec. Bricker. The histopathological examination of the 
resection specimen surprisingly revealed the presence of prostatic basal cell 
carcinoma pT4N0M0 and not urothelial cancer. Due to renal failure, the patient 
required hemodialysis. The recommendation of the multidisciplinary oncological 
meeting was to follow up with the patient by the surgeon-urologist. On imaging 
six months after surgery, it was suspicious for recurrence. Patient was 
considered for adjuvant oncological treatment.
CONCLUSION: Although rare, basal cell carcinoma of the prostate should be 
considered in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, hematuria and normal 
PSA. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor is indicated in patients 
presenting with hematuria and bladder tumor. In evaluation of such cases rare 
histological types should be included in the differential diagnosis.",© 2023 Taskovska et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/RRU.S391558

treatment method, has been extensively developed into a powerful cancer 
therapeutic technique. Nevertheless, the low photothermal conversion efficiency 
and the limited tissue penetration of typical photothermal therapeutic agents in 
the first near-infrared (NIR-I) region (700-950 nm) are still the major barriers 
for further clinical application. Here, we proposed an organic/inorganic 
dual-PTT agent of synergistic property driven by polydopamine-modified 
black-titanium dioxide (b-TiO2@PDA) with excellent photoconversion efficiency in 
the second NIR (NIR-II) region (1000-1500 nm). More specifically, the b-TiO2 
treated with sodium borohydride produced excessive oxygen vacancies resulting in 
oxygen vacancy band that narrowed the b-TiO2 band gap, and the small band gap 
led to NIR-II region wavelength (1064 nm) absorbance. Furthermore, the 
combination of defect energy level trapping carrier recombination heat 
generation and conjugate heat generation mechanism, significantly improved the 
photothermal performance of the PTT agent based on b-TiO2. The photothermal 
properties characterization indicated that the proposed dual-PTT agent possesses 
excellent photothermal performance and ultra-high photoconversion efficiency of 
64.9% under 1064 nm laser irradiation, which can completely kill esophageal 
squamous cells. Meanwhile, Gd2O3 nanoparticles, an excellent magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) agent, were introduced into the nanosystem with similar dotted 
core-shell structure to enable the nanosystem achieve real-time MRI-monitored 
cancer therapeutic performance. We believe that this integrated nanotherapeutic 
system can not only solve the application of PTT in the NIR-II region, but also 
provide certain theoretical guidance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of 
esophageal cancer.","© 2022 The Authors. Exploration published by Henan University and John Wiley &

properties owing to high omega-3 fatty acid (α-Linolenic acid), dietary fiber, 
quality protein, and lignan content. Currently, linseed enjoys the status of a 
'superfood' and its integration in the food chain as a functional food is 
evolving continuously as seed constituents are associated with lowering the risk 
of chronic ailments, such as heart diseases, cancer, diabetes, and rheumatoid 
arthritis. This crop also receives much attention in the handloom and textile 
sectors as the world's coolest fabric linen is made up of its stem fibers which 
are endowed with unique qualities such as luster, tensile strength, density, 
bio-degradability, and non-hazardous nature. Worldwide, major linseed growing 
areas are facing erratic rainfall and temperature patterns affecting flax yield, 
quality, and response to biotic stresses. Amid such changing climatic regimes 
and associated future threats, diverse linseed genetic resources would be 
crucial for developing cultivars with a broad genetic base for sustainable 
production. Furthermore, linseed is grown across the world in varied 
agro-climatic conditions; therefore it is vital to develop niche-specific 
cultivars to cater to diverse needs and keep pace with rising demands globally. 
Linseed genetic diversity conserved in global genebanks in the form of germplasm 
collection from natural diversity rich areas is expected to harbor genetic 
variants and thus form crucial resources for breeding tailored crops to specific 
culinary and industrial uses. Global genebank collections thus potentially play 
an important role in supporting sustainable agriculture and food security. 
Currently, approximately 61,000 germplasm accessions of linseed including 1,127 
wild accessions are conserved in genebanks/institutes worldwide. This review 
analyzes the current status of Linum genetic resources in global genebanks, 
evaluation for agro-morphological traits, stress tolerance, and nutritional 
profiling to promote their effective use for sustainable production and 
nutrition enhancement in our modern diets.","Copyright © 2023 Kaur, Singh, Wankhede, Gupta, Langyan, Aravind, Thangavel,

huge medical burden. The prevalence in women surpasses that in men. The role of 
vegetarian diets in the pathogenesis of the disease remains inconclusive. In 
this study, we examined the risk of VVs in vegetarian and non-vegetarian men and 
women.
METHODS: The study involved 9905 adults whose data were obtained from Taiwan 
Biobank between 2008 and 2020. Information on VVs, sex, and vegetarian diets was 
obtained from participants' self-responses to the Taiwan Biobank questionnaires.
RESULTS: The study subjects consisted of 4,142 men and 5,763 women. About 12% of 
men and 35% of women had VVs. Study participants were predominantly 
non-vegetarians (91.84% were men and 88.24% were women). Women had a higher risk 
of VVs than men. The odds ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) was 3.414; 
2.995-3.891. There was a significant interaction between sex and vegetarian 
diets (p = 0.0034). Women were at higher risk of VVs than men both in the 
vegetarian (OR = 1.877, 95% CI = 1.270-2.774) and non-vegetarian (OR = 3.674, 
95% CI = 3.197-4.223) groups. Based on vegetarian diets, only vegetarian men had 
a higher risk of VVs (OR = 1.453, 95% CI = 1.069 to 1.976). Based on the 
sex-stratified model, the risk of VVs was significantly higher in vegetarian men 
(OR = 1.457, 95% CI = 1.072-1.979), and in vegetarian and non-vegetarian women 
with corresponding ORs (95% CI) of 3.101 (2.528-3.803) and 3.599 (3.140-4.124), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Women were more susceptible to varicose veins compared to men, 
regardless of diet. However, in terms of diet, only men who followed a 
vegetarian diet were at greater risk for developing VVs.","Copyright © 2023 Tsai, Nfor, Tantoh, Lu and Liaw.","DOI: 10.3389/fnut.2023.1046158

(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, 
Saskatoon, SK, Canada.","APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes deaminate cytosine to uracil in viral single-stranded DNA 
as a mutagenic barrier for some viruses. A3-induced deaminations can also occur 
in human genomes resulting in an endogenous source of somatic mutations in 
multiple cancers. However, the roles of each A3 are unclear since few studies 
have assessed these enzymes in parallel. Thus, we developed stable cell lines 
expressing A3A, A3B, or A3H Hap I using non-tumorigenic MCF10A and tumorigenic 
MCF7 breast epithelial cells to assess their mutagenic potential and cancer 
phenotypes in breast cells. The activity of these enzymes was characterized by 
γH2AX foci formation and in vitro deamination. Cell migration and soft agar 
colony formation assays assessed cellular transformation potential. We found 
that all three A3 enzymes had similar γH2AX foci formation, despite different 
deamination activities in vitro. Notably, in nuclear lysates, the in vitro 
deaminase activity of A3A, A3B, and A3H did not require digestion of cellular 
RNA, in contrast to that of A3B and A3H in whole-cell lysates. Their similar 
activities in cells, nonetheless, resulted in distinct phenotypes where A3A 
decreased colony formation in soft agar, A3B decreased colony formation in soft 
agar after hydroxyurea treatment, and A3H Hap I promoted cell migration. 
Overall, we show that in vitro deamination data do not always reflect cell DNA 
damage, all three A3s induce DNA damage, and the impact of each is different.","Copyright © 2023 Granadillo Rodríguez, Wong and Chelico.","DOI: 10.3389/fgeed.2023.1196697

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have previously been associated with blood 
pressure (BP) levels. A combination of SNPs, forming a genetic risk score (GRS) 
could be considered as a useful genetic tool to identify individuals at risk of 
developing hypertension from early stages in life. Therefore, the aim of our 
study was to build a GRS being able to predict the genetic predisposition to 
hypertension (HTN) in European adolescents.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition 
in Adolescence (HELENA) cross-sectional study. A total of 869 adolescents (53% 
female), aged 12.5-17.5, with complete genetic and BP information were included. 
The sample was divided into altered (≥130 mmHg for systolic and/or ≥80 mmHg for 
diastolic) or normal BP. Based on the literature, a total of 1.534 SNPs from 57 
candidate genes related with BP were selected from the HELENA GWAS database.
RESULTS: From 1,534 SNPs available, An initial screening of SNPs univariately 
associated with HTN (p < 0.10) was established, to finally obtain a number of 16 
SNPs significantly associated with HTN (p < 0.05) in the multivariate model. The 
unweighted GRS (uGRS) and weighted GRS (wGRS) were estimated. To validate the 
GRSs, the area under the curve (AUC) was explored using ten-fold internal 
cross-validation for uGRS (0.802) and wGRS (0.777). Further covariates of 
interest were added to the analyses, obtaining a higher predictive ability (AUC 
values of uGRS: 0.879; wGRS: 0.881 for BMI z-score). Furthermore, the 
differences between AUCs obtained with and without the addition of covariates 
were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Both GRSs, the uGRS and wGRS, could be useful to evaluate the 
predisposition to hypertension in European adolescents.","© 2023 Pérez-Gimeno, Seral-Cortes, Sabroso-Lasa, Esteban, Lurbe, Béghin,

malignancy of women worldwide. Breast self-examination (BSE) is important for 
the early detection and prevention of BC and to limit the morbidity and 
mortality. Young students are ideal people to understand and motivate other 
women to perform BSE.
OBJECTIVE: BSE behavior of undergraduate students was predicted using Champion's 
Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS).
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted. This study was 
conducted in all nine colleges of Sultan Qaboos University, , Oman. 
Three-hundred eighty-one female undergraduate students were selected through 
convenient sampling technique. The health belief towards BSE was predicted using 
CHBMS.
RESULTS: The mean and SD of beliefs about the benefits of performing BSE showed 
10.84 and 3.2, respectively. Mean and SD of confidence in performing BSE 
indicated 56.24 and 10.8. Likewise, the mean and SD of barriers in performing 
BSE are 13.58 and 4.2. Source of information is found to be a statistically 
significant predictor of barrier in performing BSE at p < .05.
CONCLUSION: If the self- confidence of women in performing BSE improves, the 
women will uptake BSE more frequently thereby they can be prevented from 
developing the adverse consequences of advanced stages of breast cancer.",© The Author(s) 2023.,"DOI: 10.1177/23779608231179531

patients with high-risk malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Nevertheless, 
various post-allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) complications with diverse chronology, 
etiology, and pathophysiological background can develop, including general and 
organ-specific complications, such as graft dysfunction, infectious, and 
non-infectious etiologies, as well as non-infectious pulmonary complications 
(NIPCs). Post-transplant complications can also be related to conditioning 
intensity and drug-specific side effects. However, treatment options for these 
complications are suboptimal at present. Poor graft function (PGF) is a 
potentially life-threatening post-allo-HCT complication and is reported in 5-30% 
of patients. Nevertheless, consensus guidelines to define and treat PGF are not 
available. Most therapies are symptomatic with variable success rates. NIPCs are 
diverse and difficult to diagnose. The pathophysiology of NIPCs remains 
ill-defined, and effective treatment approaches have not been standardized, with 
mortality exceeding 50% for some conditions, such as idiopathic pneumonia 
syndrome (IPS). Modification of the conditioning regimen intensity and 
introduction of novel agents have been used to decrease post-allo-HCT 
complications, including infections, non-infectious complications, 
graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), as well as cardiopulmonary, neurological, 
hepatorenal, and other complications. Transplant-associated thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a lethal post-allo-HCT complication that may be 
associated with functional and genetic abnormalities in complement activation 
and related to the use of calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and 
tacrolimus. The introduction of complement inhibitors has transformed TA-TMA

materials is an encouraging and innovativeness approach to nanotechnology. Among 
other synthesizing methods, biological methods are chosen because of their high 
efficiency and purity in many aspects. In this work, using the aqueous extract 
obtained from the green leaves of the D. kaki L. (DK); silver nanoparticles were 
synthesized in a short time and simply with an eco-friendly approach. The 
properties of the synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were characterized 
using various techniques and measurements. In the characterization data of 
AgNPs, Maximum absorbance at 453.34 nm wavelengths, the average size 
distribution of 27.12 nm, the surface charge of -22.4 mV, and spherical 
appearance were observed. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was used to assess the compound 
composition of D. kaki leaf extract. The chemical profiling of the crude extract 
of D. kaki leaves revealed the presence of a variety of phytochemicals, 
predominantly phenolics, resulting in the identification of five major 
high-feature compounds: two major phenolic acids (Chlorogenic acid and Cynarin), 
and tree flavonol glucosides (hyperoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, and 
quercetin-3- D-xyloside). The components with the highest concentrations were 
cynarin, chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3- D-xyloside, hyperoside, and 
quercetin-3-glucoside, respectively. Antimicrobial results were determined by a 
MIC assay. The biosynthesized AgNPs exhibited strong antibacterial activity 
against the human and food pathogen Gram (+ and -) bacteria and good antifungal 
activity against pathogenic yeast. It was determined that 0.03-0.050 μg/mL 
concentrations ranges of DK-AgNPs were growth suppressive concentrations on all 
pathogen microorganisms. The MTT technique was used to study the cytotoxic 
effects of produced AgNPs on cancer cell lines (Glioblastoma (U118), Human 
Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), Human Ovarian Sarcoma (Skov-3) cancer cell 
lines, and Human Dermal Fibroblast (HDF) healthy cell line). It has been 
observed that they have a suppressive effect on the proliferation of cancerous 
cell lines. After 48 h of treatment with Ag-NPs, the DK-AgNPs were found to be 
extremely cytotoxic to the CaCo-2 cell line, inhibiting cell viability by up to 
59.49% at a concentration of 50 g mL-1. It was found that the viability was 
inversely related to the DK-AgNP concentration. The biosynthesized AgNPs had 
dose-dependent anticancer efficacy. Because of the high concentration of 
bioactive chemicals in Diospyros kaki, it may be employed as a biological

molecular pathogenesis remaining uncertain. This study aimed to identify the 
differentially expressed proteins and potential pathways among achalasia 
subtypes and controls to further reveal the molecular pathogenesis of achalasia.
METHODS: Paired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) muscle and serum samples from 
24 achalasia patients were collected. We also collected 10 normal serum samples 
from healthy controls and 10 normal LES muscle samples from esophageal cancer 
patients. The 4D label-free proteomic analysis was performed to identify the 
potential proteins and pathways involved in achalasia.
RESULTS: Analysis of Similarities showed distinct proteomic patterns of serum 
and muscle samples between achalasia patients and controls (both P < 0.05). 
Functional enrichment analysis suggested that these differentially expressed 
proteins were immunity-, infection-, inflammation-, and 
neurodegeneration-associated. The mfuzz analysis in LES specimens showed that 
proteins involved in the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction increased 
sequentially between the control group, type III, type II, and type I achalasia. 
Only 26 proteins altered in the same directions in serum and muscle samples.
CONCLUSIONS: This first 4D label-free proteomic study of achalasia indicated 
that there were specific protein alterations in both the serum and muscle of 
achalasia, involving immunity, inflammation, infection, and neurodegeneration 
pathways. Distinct protein clusters between types I, II, and III revealed the 
potential molecular pathways associated with different disease stages. Analysis 
of proteins changed in both muscle and serum samples highlighted the importance 
of further studies on LES muscle and revealed potential autoantibodies.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press and Sixth Affiliated

(1)Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental 
Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.","Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive type of 
intracranial tumor. However, PCNSL is radiosensitive; thus, whole-brain 
radiotherapy (WBRT) is often selected as an alternative consolidation therapy. 
WBRT-related delayed neurotoxicity can affect the quality of life of the 
elderly. 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a natural precursor of heme and has been 
widely used as a live molecular fluorescence marker in brain tumor surgery. 
Experimental studies have demonstrated that combination therapy with 5-ALA and 
ionizing irradiation (IR), denoted radiodynamic therapy (RDT), resulted in tumor 
suppression in cancer, including glioma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, prostate 
cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer; however, to the best of our knowledge, 
this method has not been investigated in lymphoma. The present study aimed to 
investigate the radiodynamic effect of 5-ALA on lymphoma cells in vitro. The 
synthesis of 5-ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) was assessed under normal 
and hypoxic conditions in lymphoma cells (Raji, HKBML and TK). Subsequently, the 
radiodynamic effect of 5-ALA was evaluated using a colony formation assay and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after RDT was examined using flow 
cytometry. Finally, the mitochondrial density in the lymphoma cells was 
evaluated. Lymphoma cells exhibited a high accumulation of 5-ALA-induced PpIX in 
the flow cytometric analysis, and a decrease in the surviving fraction under IR 
in cells with 5-ALA treatment compared with cells not treated with 5-ALA in the 
colony formation assay under normal and hypoxic conditions. Although ROS 
production 12 h after IR was increased compared with that immediately after IR 
(0 h), pretreatment with 5-ALA enhanced the delayed ROS production in each 
lymphoma cell line under normoxic conditions. Raji and TK cells exhibited an 
increase in ROS production 12 h after IR compared with that at 0 h in the 
5-ALA-untreated cells under hypoxic conditions. Raji, HKBML and TK cells 
exhibited an increase in ROS production 12 h after IR compared with that at 0 h 
in the 5-ALA-treated cells, while TK cells exhibited enhancement of ROS 
production 12 h after IR in 5-ALA-treated cells compared with 5-ALA-untreated 
cells under hypoxic conditions. Other studies have demonstrated that impaired 
mitochondria damaged by IR produce ROS via the metabolic process, then damage 
the rest of the surrounding normal mitochondria, consequently propagating 
oxidative stress within tumor cells and leading to cell death. Thus, we 
hypothesized that the propagating oxidative stress after IR was associated with 
mitochondrial density in tumor cells. Namely, high accumulation of 5-ALA-indcued 
PpIX may promote ROS production in mitochondria of tumor cells after IR, and 
suppress the cell surviving fraction via the propagation of oxidative stress. In 
the colony formation assay, Raji cell colony formation was suppressed by RDT 
with 5-ALA. Simultaneously, the mitochondrial density in the Raji cells was 
higher than that in other cell lines. Pretreatment with 5-ALA enhanced delayed 
ROS production after IR in lymphoma cells under normoxic conditions. Under 
hypoxic conditions, only TK cells exhibited enhancement of ROS production 12 h 
after IR in the 5-ALA-treated group compared with the 5-ALA-untreated group. 
Although further studies evaluating the effect of hypoxic conditions in lymphoma 
cells are needed, the results suggested that RDT with 5-ALA could suppress 
colony formation under normal and hypoxic conditions in lymphoma cells. 
Therefore, RDT with 5-ALA is a potential treatment option for PCNSL.","Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications.","DOI: 10.3892/etm.2023.12059

gastrectomy with postoperative double-channel digestive tract reconstruction.
METHODS: A total of 40 patients with proximal gastric cancer who underwent 
gastrectomy in Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, were selected to 
collect relevant clinical data. They were divided into two groups according to 
their treatment methods: TG-RY group (total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y 
reconstruction group) and PG-DT group (proximal gastrectomy with double tract 
reconstruction group). The general data, perioperative indicators, nutritional 
indicators, and postoperative complications of the two groups were analyzed and 
compared.
RESULTS: There was no statistical significance in the comparison of general data 
between the two groups, but the proportion of III stage patients of TNM stage in 
the PG-DT group was larger than that in the TG-RY group. Meanwhile, the 
intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, and first exhaust time 
in PG-DT group were lower than those in TG-RY group (P < 0.05). After surgery, 
the nutritional indexes of the PG-DT group decreased, and the decrease degree 
was less than that of the TG-RY group, while the infection indicators of the 
PG-DT group increased less than that of the TG-RY group. Statistical analysis of 
postoperative complications showed that the total incidence of PG-DT group was 
lower than that of TG-RY group.
CONCLUSION: Proximal gastric cancer resection and postoperative DTR anastomosis 
can effectively speed up the recovery of patients and reduce the incidence of 
postoperative complications, with good efficacy. This experiment provides 
evidence for the advantages of various postoperative anastomosis methods and 
also provides a reliable basis for clinicians' diagnosis and treatment, thus

therapeutic efficacy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods: We 
constructed 17 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from PDAC patient samples 
and identified the most notable responder to gemcitabine by screening the PDX 
sets in vivo. To analyze tumor evolution and microenvironmental changes pre- and 
post-chemotherapy, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed. 
Results: ScRNA-seq revealed that gemcitabine promoted the expansion of subclones 
associated with drug resistance and recruited macrophages related to tumor 
progression and metastasis. We further investigated the particular 
drug-resistant subclone and established a gemcitabine sensitivity gene panel 
(GSGP) (SLC46A1, PCSK1N, KRT7, CAV2, and LDHA), dividing PDAC patients into two 
groups to predict the overall survival (OS) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
training dataset. The signature was successfully validated in three independent 
datasets. We also found that 5-GSGP predicted the sensitivity to gemcitabine in 
PDAC patients in the TCGA training dataset who were treated with gemcitabine. 
Discussion and conclusion: Our study provides new insight into the natural 
selection of tumor cell subclones and remodeling of tumor microenvironment (TME) 
cells induced by gemcitabine. We revealed a specific drug resistance subclone, 
and based on the characteristics of this subclone, we constructed a GSGP that 
can robustly predict gemcitabine sensitivity and prognosis in pancreatic cancer, 
which provides a theoretical basis for individualized clinical treatment.","Copyright © 2023 Hou, Lin, Ma, Fang, Wu, Chen, Lin, Lu, Wen, Yu, Huang and Pan.","DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2023.1193791

primarily involves the recta and colons. It mostly presents as a long course of 
repeated attacks. This disease, characterized by intermittent diarrhoea, fecal

persons. UC is difficult to heal, has a high recurrence rate, and is tightly 
related to the incidence of colon cancer. Although there are a number of drugs 
available for the suppression of colitis, the conventional therapy possesses 
certain limitations and severe adverse reactions. Thus, it is extremely required 
for safe and effective medicines for colitis, and naturally derived flavones 
exhibited huge prospects. This study focused on the advancement of naturally 
derived flavones from edible and pharmaceutical plants for treating colitis. The 
underlying mechanisms of natural-derived flavones in treating UC were closely 
linked to the regulation of enteric barrier function, immune-inflammatory

drug, and it causes damage to the heart, liver, and kidneys through oxidative 
stress. Theobroma cacao L (cocoa) is reported to possess protective effects 
against several chemical-induced organ damages and also acts as an anticancer 
agent. The study aimed to determine whether the administration of cocoa bean 
extract reduces doxorubicin-induced organ damage in mice with Ehrlich ascites 
carcinoma (EAC) without compromising doxorubicin efficacy. Methodology: Multiple 
in vitro methods such as cell proliferation, colony formation, 
chemo-sensitivity, and scratch assay were carried out on cancer as well as 
normal cell lines to document the effect of cocoa extract (COE) on cellular 
physiology, followed by in vivo mouse survival analysis, and the 
organ-protective effect of COE on DOX-treated animals with EAC-induced solid 
tumors was then investigated. In silico studies were conducted on cocoa 
compounds with lipoxygenase and xanthine oxidase to provide possible molecular 
explanations for the experimental observations. Results: In vitro studies 
revealed potent selective cytotoxicity of COE on cancer cells compared to 
normal. Interestingly, COE enhanced DOX potency when used in combination. The in 
vivo results revealed reduction in EAC and DOX-induced toxicities in mice 
treated with COE, which also improved the mouse survival time; percentage of 
lifespan; antioxidant defense system; renal, hepatic, and cardiac function 
biomarkers; and also oxidative stress markers. COE reduced DOX-induced 
histopathological alterations. Through molecular docking and MD simulations, we 
observed chlorogenic acid and 8'8 methylenebiscatechin, present in cocoa, to 
have the highest binding affinity with lipoxygenase and xanthine oxidase, which 
lends support to their potential in ameliorating oxidative stress. Conclusion: 
The COE reduced DOX-induced organ damage in the EAC-induced tumor model and 
exhibited powerful anticancer and antioxidant effects. Therefore, COE might be 
useful as an adjuvant nutritional supplement in cancer therapy.","Copyright © 2023 Patil, Kumar, Khanal, Patil, Darasaguppe, Bhandare, Bhatkande,

safe withdrawal when a potentially inappropriate use is detected. This 
represents a challenge in chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) patients who may 
respond differently to the procedure. Our aim was to analyze the potential 
impact of CYP2D6 phenotypes and sex on the clinical and safety outcomes during 
an opioid use disorder (OUD) tapering process. Methods: A prospective 
observational study was conducted on CNCP ambulatory OUD patients (cases, n = 
138) who underwent a 6-month opioid dose reduction and discontinuation. Pain 
intensity, relief and quality of life (Visual analogue scale, VAS 0-100 mm), 
global activity (GAF, 0-100 scores), morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), 
analgesic drugs adverse events (AEs) and opioid withdrawal syndrome (OWS, 0-96 
scores) were recorded at basal and final visits. Sex differences and CYP2D6 
phenotypes (poor (PM), extensive (EM) and ultrarapid (UM) metabolizers based on 
CYP2D6*1, *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *10, *17, *41, 2D6*5, 2D6 × N, 2D6*4 × 2 gene 
variants) were analyzed. Results: Although CYP2D6-UM consumed three-times less 
basal MEDD [40 (20-123) mg/day, p = 0.04], they showed the highest number of AEs 
[7 (6-11), p = 0.02] and opioid withdrawal symptoms (46 ± 10 scores, p = 0.01) 
after deprescription. This was inversely correlated with their quality of life 
(r = -0.604, p < 0.001). Sex-differences were evidenced with a tendency to a 
lower analgesic tolerability in females and lower quality of life in men. 
Discussion: These data support the potential benefits of CYP2D6-guided opioid 
deprescription, in patients with CNCP when OUD is detected. Further studies are 
required to understand a sex/gender interaction.","Copyright © 2023 Muriel, Barrachina, Del Barco, Carvajal, Escorial, Margarit,

short survival due to resistance. Triptolide (TPL) is considered to have 
multifunctional antitumor effects and has been confirmed to enhance the 
cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. Herein, we aimed to investigate the 
knowledge about the effects and mechanisms for the combined application of TPL 
and CBP against melanoma. Methods: Melanoma cell lines and xenograft mouse model 
were used to uncover the antitumor effects and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms of the alone or combined treatment of TPL and CBP in melanoma. Cell 
viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and DNA damage were detected by 
conventional methods. The rate-limiting proteins of the NER pathway were 
quantitated using PCR and Western blot. Fluorescent reporter plasmids were used 
to test the NER repair capacity. Results: Our results showed that the presence 
of TPL in CBP treatment could selectively inhibit NER pathway activity, and TPL 
exerts a synergistic effect with CBP to inhibit viability, migration, invasion, 
and induce apoptosis of A375 and B16 cells. Moreover, combined treatment with 
TPL and CBP significantly inhibited tumor progression in nude mice by 
suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Discussion: This study

clinically effective for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer 
recurrence and metastasis. According to the theory of TCM, YWD tonifies the body 
and strengthens the body's resistance to gastric cancer recurrence and 
metastasis potentially via the immune regulation of the spleen. The aims of the 
present study were to investigate whether YWD-treated spleen-derived exosomes in 
rats inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, to elucidate the anticancer 
effects of YWD, and to provide evidence supporting the use of YWD as a new 
clinical treatment for gastric cancer. Spleen-derived exosomes were obtained by 
ultracentrifugation and identified by transmission electron microscopy, 
nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot analysis. The location of the 
exosomes in tumor cells was then determined by immunofluorescence staining. 
After tumor cells were treated with different concentrations of exosomes, the 
effect of exosomes on cell proliferation was determined by cell counting kit 8 
(CCK8) and colony formation assays. Tumor cell apoptosis was detected by flow 
cytometry. Particle analysis and western blot analysis identified the material 
extracted from spleen tissue supernatant as exosomes. Immunofluorescence 
staining showed that spleen-derived exosomes were taken up by HGC-27 cells, and 
the CCK8 assay confirmed that the relative tumor inhibition rate of YWD-treated 
spleen-derived exosomes in the 30 μg/mL reached 70.78% compared to control 
exosomes in the 30 μg/mL (p < 0.05). Compared to control exosomes in the 
30 μg/mL, the colony formation assay indicated that YWD-treated spleen-derived 
exosomes in the 30 μg/mL colonies have decreased by 99.03% (p < 0.01). Moreover, 
flow cytometry analysis showed that treatment with YWD-treated exosomes in the 
30 μg/mL increased the apoptosis rate to 43.27%, which was significantly higher 
than that of the control group in the 30 μg/mL (25.91%) (p < 0.05). In 
conclusion, spleen-derived exosomes from YWD-treated animals inhibit the 
proliferation of HGC-27 cells via inducing apoptosis, suggesting that 
spleen-derived exosomes are involved in mediating the antitumor effect of YWD. 
These results demonstrated a novel exosome-mediated anticancer effect of YWD as 
a TCM formula, thereby supporting the use of YWD-treated exosomes as a new 
approach for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer.","Copyright © 2023 Chen, Li, Wu, Chen, Jin, Chen, Fei, Xue, Wu and Chai.","DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2023.1144955

COL5A1), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) in pancreatic cancer and 
para-carcinoma tissues were compared using immunohistochemical methods, and 
their relationships with TNM staging were analyzed. The effects of TQ on 
apoptosis, migration, invasion, and GEM sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells 
were assessed using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Western blot and 
immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression levels of HIF-1α, 
extracellular matrix (ECM) production pathway-related proteins, and TGFβ/Smad 
signaling pathway-related proteins. Results: The expression levels of HIF-1α, 
COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and TGFβ1 in pancreatic cancer tissues were 
significantly higher than those in para-carcinoma tissues and correlated with 
TNM staging (p < 0.05). TQ and GEM administration inhibited the migration and 
invasion of the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and promoted the 
apoptosis of PANC-1 cells. The combination of TQ and GEM was more effective than 
GEM alone. Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of HIF-1α, 
ECM production pathway-related proteins, and TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway-related 
proteins were significantly decreased when TQ was used to treat PANC-1 cells (p 
< 0.05), and the expression levels of these proteins in the TQ + GEM group were 
significantly more decreased than those in the GEM group. Overexpression or 
knockdown of HIF-1α in PANC-1 cells showed the same effects as those induced by 
TQ administration. In vivo experiments showed that in PANC-1 tumor-bearing mice, 
tumor volume and tumor weight in mice treated with GEM and TQ were significantly 
lower than those in control or GEM-treated mice, whereas cell apoptosis was 
significantly increased (p < 0.05). Western blot and immunohistochemistry 
results showed that the levels of HIF-1α, ECM production pathway-related 
proteins, and TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway-related proteins in the GEM + TQ 
treatment group were further decreased compared to the control group or the GEM 
treatment group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In pancreatic cancer cells, TQ can 
promote apoptosis, inhibit migration, invasion, and metastasis, and enhance the 
sensitivity to GEM. The underlying mechanism may involve the regulation of ECM 
production through the TGFβ/Smad pathway, in which HIF-1α plays a key role.","Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Liu, Chen, Li, Guo, Hou and Yang.","DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2023.1138265

hypoxia results from abnormal vessel architecture. Numerous studies have 
sufficiently demonstrated that Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) can increase blood flow 
and enhance microcirculation. The objectives of this study are to: 1 assess the 
impact of Tan IIA on tumor angiogenesis and architecture, 2 determine the impact 
of Tan IIA on tumor hypoxia and susceptibility to Sorafenib, and 3 clarify the 
relevant mechanisms. Methods: CCK8 and flow cytometry measured cell 
proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Tube creation assay was used to 
investigate medication effects on angiogenesis and structure. Drug effects on 
tumor development, metastasis, and hypoxic tumor microenvironment are assessed 
in an orthotopic xenograft model of liver tumors. Protein expression was 
measured by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: Our results 
demonstrated that Tan IIA could not reduce tumor proliferation or enhance 
Sorafenib's anti-tumor effect in vitro. Nevertheless, it can prevent Sorafenib 
from demolishing the typical vascular structure and aid sorafenib in blocking 
the recruitment of vascular endothelial cells by liver cancer cells. Although 
Tan IIA cannot inhibit tumor growth in vivo, it can significantly boost 
Sorafenib's inhibitory effect on liver cancer, alleviate tumor microenvironment 
hypoxia, and minimize lung metastasis. This effect may be achieved by reducing 
HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression via the PI3K-AKT signal pathway. Discussion: Our 
results reveal the mechanism of Tan IIA in normalizing tumor blood vessels, 
provide innovative concepts and approaches to overcome chemotherapy resistance, 
and provide a theoretical basis for the clinical transformation and usage of Tan 
IIA.","Copyright © 2023 Qin, Liu, Zhou, Xia, Hu, Yu and Ma.","DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2023.1189532

Systematic chemotherapy shows limited efficacy in patients with advanced 
disease, while targeted therapy and immunotherapy may provide a reasonable 
alternative for specific populations. The molecular pattern of colorectal cancer 
(CRC) have recently been identified; this understanding has significantly 
influenced the clinical management of CRC in terms of molecular-targeted 
therapy. Although some genetic alterations have been associated with UrC, there 
is still no systematic overview of the molecular profile of this rare 
malignancy. Methods: In this review, we comprehensively discuss the molecular 
profile of UrC and further identify potential targets for the personalized 
treatment of UrC as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors that represent 
underlying biomarkers. A systematic literature search was carried out by 
searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to identify all 
literature related to targeted therapy and immunotherapy in urachal carcinoma 
from inception to February 2023. Results: A total of 28 articles were eligible, 
and most studies included were case report sand retrospective case series. 
Furthermore, 420 cases of UrC were identified to analyze the association between 
mutations and UrC. The most commonly mutated gene in UrC was TP53 with the 
prevalence of 70%, followed by KRAS mutations in 28.3%, MYC mutations in 20.3%, 
SMAD4 mutations in 18.2% and GNAS mutations in 18%, amongst other genes. 
Discussion: The molecular patterns of UrC and CRC are similar yet distinct. 
Notably, targeted therapy, especially EGFR-targeting therapy, might provide 
curative efficacy for patients with UrC by applying specific molecular markers. 
Additional potential biomarkers for the immunotherapy of UrC are mismatch repair 
(MMR) status and PD-L1 expression profile. In addition, combined regimens

contributors to the global cancer burden, and China has the highest morbidity 
and mortality rates in the world. As a well-known Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) 
prescription, Huatan Sanjie Granules (HSG) has been used clinically for many 
years to treat PLC with remarkable efficacy, but the underlying mechanism of 
action remains unclear. Methods: A clinical cohort study was conducted to 
observe the overall survival of PLC patients with vs. without oral 
administration of HSG. Meanwhile, the BATMAN-TCM database was used to retrieve 
the potential active ingredients in the six herbs of HSG and their corresponding 
drug targets. PLC-related targets were then screened through the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of targets 
of HSG against PLC was constructed using Cytoscape software. The cell function 
assays were further carried out for verification. Results: The results of the 
cohort study showed that the median survival time of PLC patients exposed to HSG 
was 269 days, which was 23 days longer than that of the control group (HR, 0.62; 
95% CI, 0.38-0.99; p = 0.047). In particular, the median survival time of 
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C patients was 411 days in the exposure 
group, which was 137 days longer than that in the control group (HR, 0.59; 95% 
CI, 0.35-0.96; p = 0.036). Meanwhile, the enrichment analysis result for the 
obtained PPI network consisting of 362 potential core therapeutic targets 
suggest that HSG may inhibit the growth of liver cancer (LC) cells by blocking 
the PI3K-Akt/MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, the above prediction results 
were verified by a series of in vitro assays. Specifically, we found that the 
expressions TP53 and YWHA2, the targets of the hepatitis B virus signaling 
pathway, were significantly affected by HSG. Conclusion: HSG shows promising 
therapeutic efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of PLC.","Copyright © 2023 Yuan, Abdurahman, Cui, Hao, Zou, Liu and Wu.","DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2023.1091177

therapies for efficacy. To this end, we developed a multi-well perfusable 
bioreactor capable of monitoring CRCLM patient-derived organoid response to a 
chemotherapeutic gradient. CRCLM patient-derived organoids were cultured in the 
multi-well bioreactor for 7 days and the subsequently established gradient in 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) concentration resulted in a lower IC50 in the region near 
the perfusion channel versus the region far from the channel. We compared 
behaviour of organoids in this platform to two commonly used PDO culture models: 
organoids in media and organoids in a static (no perfusion) hydrogel. The 
bioreactor IC50 values were significantly higher than IC50 values for organoids 
cultured in media whereas only the IC50 for organoids far from the channel were 
significantly different than organoids cultured in the static hydrogel 
condition. Using finite element simulations, we showed that the total dose 
delivered, calculated using area under the curve (AUC) was similar between 
platforms, however normalized viability was lower for the organoid in media 
condition than in the static gel and bioreactor. Our results highlight the 
utility of our multi-well bioreactor for studying organoid response to chemical

(n = 38) and breast cancer survivors (n = 27) within 2 years of treatment, and 
whether any group-differences were influenced by age, cytomegalovirus infection, 
cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition. Using flow cytometry, CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cell subsets, including naïve (NA), central memory (CM) and effector 
cells (EM and EMRA) were identified using CD27/CD45RA. Activation was measured 
by HLA-DR expression. Stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCMs) were identified 
using CD95/CD127. B cells, including plasmablasts, memory, immature and naïve 
cells were identified using CD19/CD27/CD38/CD10. Effector and regulatory Natural 
Killer cells were identified using CD56/CD16. Results: Compared to healthy 
women, CD4+ CM were +Δ21% higher among survivors (p = 0.028) and CD8+ NA were 
-Δ25% lower (p = 0.034). Across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, the proportion of 
activated (HLA-DR+) cells was +Δ31% higher among survivors: CD4+ CM (+Δ25%), 
CD4+ EM (+Δ32%) and CD4+ EMRA (+Δ43%), total CD8+ (+Δ30%), CD8+ EM (+Δ30%) and 
CD8+ EMRA (+Δ25%) (p < 0.046). The counts of immature B cells, NK cells and 
CD16+ NK effector cells were higher among survivors (+Δ100%, +Δ108% and +Δ143% 
respectively, p < 0.04). Subsequent analyses examined whether statistically 
significant differences in participant characteristics, influenced immunological 
differences between groups. Compared to healthy women, survivors were older (56 
± 6 y vs. 45 ± 11 y), had lower cardiorespiratory fitness (V˙O2max mL kg-1 
min-1: 28.8 ± 5.0 vs. 36.2 ± 8.5), lower lean mass (42.3 ± 5.0 kg vs. 48.4 ± 
15.8 kg), higher body fat (36.3% ± 5.3% vs. 32.7% ± 6.4%) and higher fat mass 
index (FMI kg/m2: 9.5 ± 2.2 vs. 8.1 ± 2.7) (all p < 0.033). Analysis of 
covariance revealed divergent moderating effects of age, CMV serostatus, 
cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition on the differences in immune cell 
profiles between groups, depending on the cell type examined. Moreover, across 
all participants, fat mass index was positively associated with the proportion 
of HLA-DR+ CD4+ EMRA and CD8+ EM/EMRA T cells (Pearson correlation: r > 0.305, p 
< 0.019). The association between fat mass index and HLA-DR+ CD8+ EMRA T cells 
withstood statistical adjustment for all variables, including age, CMV 
serostatus, lean mass and cardiorespiratory fitness, potentially implicating

and benign pulmonary nodules and to construct a lung cancer risk warning model 
using machine learning methods. Methods: From July 2020 to March 2022, we 
collected 862 participants including 263 patients with lung cancer, 292 patients 
with benign pulmonary nodules, and 307 healthy subjects. The TFDA-1 digital 
tongue diagnosis instrument was used to capture tongue images, using feature 
extraction technology to obtain the index of the tongue images. The statistical 
characteristics and correlations of the tongue index were analyzed, and six 
machine learning algorithms were used to build prediction models of lung cancer 
based on different data sets. Results: Patients with benign pulmonary nodules 
had different statistical characteristics and correlations of tongue image data 
than patients with lung cancer. Among the models based on tongue image data, the 
random forest prediction model performed the best, with a model accuracy of 
0.679 ± 0.048 and an AUC of 0.752 ± 0.051. The accuracy for the logistic 
regression, decision tree, SVM, random forest, neural network, and naïve bayes 
models based on both the baseline and tongue image data were 0.760 ± 0.021, 
0.764 ± 0.043, 0.774 ± 0.029, 0.770 ± 0.050, 0.762 ± 0.059, and 0.709 ± 0.052,

Conclusion: The tongue diagnosis data under the guidance of traditional Chinese 
medicine diagnostic theory was useful. The performance of models built on tongue 
image and baseline data was superior to that of the models built using only the 
tongue image data or the baseline data. Adding objective tongue image data to 
baseline data can significantly improve the efficacy of lung cancer prediction

vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling promotes endothelial 
proliferation. Notch and its downstream targets act to lead endothelial cells 
toward an arterial fate through regulation of arterial gene expression. However, 
the mechanisms of how endothelial cells (ECs) in the artery maintain their 
arterial characteristics remain unclear. Here, we show that PRDM16 (positive 
regulatory domain-containing protein 16), a zinc finger transcription factor, is 
expressed in arterial ECs, but not venous ECs in developing embryos and neonatal 
retinas. Endothelial-specific deletion of Prdm16 induced ectopic venous marker 
expression in the arterial ECs and reduced vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) 
recruitment around arteries. Whole-genome transcriptome analysis using isolated 
brain ECs show that the expression of Angpt2 (encoding ANGIOPOIETIN2, which 
inhibits vSMC recruitment) is upregulated in the Prdm16 knockout ECs. 
Conversely, forced expression of PRDM16 in venous ECs is sufficient to induce 
arterial gene expression and repress the ANGPT2 level. Together, these results 
reveal an arterial cell-autonomous function for PRDM16 in suppressing venous 
characteristics in arterial ECs.","Copyright © 2023 Thompson, Sakabe, Verba, Hao, Meadows, Lu and Xin.","DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2023.1165379

METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, we evaluated a total of 89 
women with low-grade smears (54 ASCUS, 35 LSIL) recruited from a tertiary care 
hospital. All patients underwent colposcopy guided cervical biopsy. 
Histopathology was used as gold standard. All samples were subjected to HPV 
16/18 genotyping (excluding 9) using DNA PCR and p16/Ki67 dual staining 
(excluding 4) using Roche® kit. We then compared the two triage methods to 
detect high-grade cervical lesions.
RESULTS: Overall, in all low-grade smears sensitivity, specificity and accuracy 
of HPV 16/18 genotyping, was found to be 66.7%, 77.1% and 76.2% respectively 
(p = 0.03). In low-grade smears sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of dual 
staining, was found to be 66.7%, 84.8% and 83.5% respectively (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in all low-grade smears the sensitivity of the two tests 
was comparable. However, dual staining had a higher specificity and accuracy 
than HPV 16/18 genotyping. It was concluded that both are effective triage 
methods but dual staining had a better performance than HPV 16/18 genotyping.","© Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India 2023. Springer

of the upper digestive tract after esophagectomy. However, this technique 
sometimes causes postoperative anastomotic leakage or stricture, resulting from 
congestion of the gastric tube. We performed additional microvascular venous 
anastomoses to solve this problem. The purpose of this study was to compare 
postoperative anastomotic leaks and strictures in cases with or without 
additional venous superdrainage after gastric tube reconstruction.
METHODS: A total of 117 consecutive patients with cervical and thoracic 
esophageal cancer who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy with gastric tube 
reconstruction in the National Nagasaki Medical Center between 2011 and 2021 
were analyzed retrospectively. Of these patients, 46 did not undergo additional 
venous anastomoses (standard group), and 71 who underwent gastric pull-up 
surgery after November 2014 have added this surgical procedure to their routine 
(superdrainage group). We compared the frequency of postsurgical leakage and 
stricture in the 2 groups retrospectively.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients (32.6%) developed postoperative leakage in the 
standard group and 6 (8.5%) did so in the superdrainage group. Twelve patients 
(26.1%) showed postoperative anastomotic stricture in the standard group and 7 
(9.9%) did so in the superdrainage group. Patients who did not undergo 
additional venous superdrainage were significantly more likely to develop 
postsurgical leakage (χ2 test P < .01) and anastomotic stricture (χ2 test 
P < .05). The mean time taken to perform additional venous anastomoses was 
54.2 minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that performing additional venous anastomosis 
for as little as 1 hour can significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative 
leakage and stenosis. This procedure is of merit to perform after total 
esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction.",© 2023 The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1016/j.xjtc.2023.03.005

etiological agent of gastric diseases such as gastritis, ulcers, and gastric 
cancer. It infects approximately half of the world's population. Risk factors 
associated with H. pylori infection include socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and 
diet.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association between eating habits 
and H. pylori infection in patients from a reference hospital in Central Brazil.
DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included 156 patients from 2019 to 2022.
METHODS: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire on 
sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics and a validated food frequency 
questionnaire. The H. pylori infection status (positive versus negative) was 
determined using the histopathological method. After grams/day, foods were 
stratified into tertiles of consumption (low, medium, and high). Simple and 
multiple binary logistic regression models were used in the analysis of odds 
ratios (ORs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with a 5% 
significance level.
RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 44.2% (69/156 patients). 
Infected individuals had a mean age of 49.6 ± 14.6 years; 40.6% were men, 34.8% 
were aged 60 years or older, 42.0% were unmarried, 7.2% had higher education, 
72.5% were non-white, and 30.4% were obese. In the H. pylori-positive group, 
55.1% were alcohol drinkers and 42.0% were smokers. The results of multiple 
analyses showed that the chance of H. pylori infection was higher among male 
participants (OR = 2.25; CI = 1.09-4.68) and individuals with obesity 
(OR = 2.68; CI = 1.10-6.51). Participants with moderate consumption of refined 
grains (bread, cookies, cakes, breakfast cereal) (OR = 2.41; CI = 1.04-5.62) and 
fruits (OR = 2.53; CI = 1.08-5.94) were more likely to be infected.
CONCLUSION: In this study, male sex, obesity, and the consumption of refined 
grains and fruits were positively associated with H. pylori infection. Further 
research is needed to investigate this association and elucidate the underlying 
mechanisms.","© The Author(s), 2023.","DOI: 10.1177/17562848231160620

progression after first-line chemotherapy and have a good performance status. 
The aim of our study is thus to determine which chemotherapy regimen is more 
appropriate for second-line gastric cancer treatment. Patients were included if 
they met the following inclusion criteria: metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma 
pathology; no previous treatment for local gastric cancer (surgery, 
chemotherapy, or radiotherapy); received first-line chemotherapy for metastatic 
gastric cancer and had the disease progress afterward; had adequate organ 
functions for second-line chemotherapy; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) score 0-2; and were HER-2 negative. The patients were examined in 
three groups according to the second-line chemotherapy regimen they received. 
These three groups were compared in terms of overall and progression-free 
survival. The three groups were statistically similar in overall survival, which 
was the primary endpoint of the study; the median overall survival was 5 months 
in the FOLFIRI group (n = 79), 6.5 months in the platinum-based group (n = 55), 
and 5.6 months in the taxane-based group (n = 40) (p = 0.554). There was no 
statistical difference between the groups' progression-free survival either; the 
median progression-free survival time was 3.43 months in the FOLFIRI group, 
4 months in the platinum-based group, and 2.77 months in the taxane-based group 
(p = 0.546). There was no statistically significant difference between the three 
irinotecan-based, platinum-based, and taxane-based treatments. According to our 
study's results, the chemotherapy given in second-line treatment should be 
decided on an individual basis according to toxicity and cost.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical

advanced colon cancer (LACC) remain unclear as conflicting results have been 
reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to examine these factors 
in the setting of developing country's health care system affected by limited 
accessibility to the multimodal cancer treatment. Patients who had undergone 
curative colon resection for LACC between 2004 and 2018 were included. Data were 
obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Factors associated with 
disease recurrence, types of recurrence and recurrence-free survival were 
studied. A total of 118 patients with LACC were operated within the study 
period. Median follow-up was 36 (2-147) months. Adjuvant therapy was used in 41 
(34.7%) patients and 62 (52.5%) were diagnosed with recurrence. In the 
multivariable analysis, disease recurrence was associated with tumor and nodal 
stages, as well as with the lymph node yield. Local recurrence, distant 
metastases, and peritoneal carcinomatosis were observed in 8 (6.8%), 30 (25.4%), 
and 24 (20.3%) patients, respectively. Early recurrence was diagnosed in 27 
(22.9%) cases with peritoneal carcinomatosis being its most common type. 
Preoperative serum CA 19-9 levels, tumor, and nodal stages were linked to 
recurrence-free survival in the univariable analysis. Only tumor stage remained 
such in the multivariable model. Our findings suggest that lymph node yield, 
tumor, and nodal stages are associated with recurrence following curative 
resection for LACC.

evaluation of trismus and its treatment outcomes needs a multidimensional, 
self-administered, trismus specific tool. In the present scenario, Gothenburg 
trismus questionnaire is the only reliable instrument to quantify trismus. 
Translation of this questionnaire helps in providing standardized documentation 
of trismus related problems and to obtain a patient's perspective on treatment 
outcomes within various populations. The aim of this study was to translate the 
Gothenburg trismus questionnaire-2 (GTQ 2) into Telugu (one of the Indian 
Languages) and validation of the translation for its effective use in regional 
Telugu speaking patients. The GTQ 2 was translated according to the guidelines 
framed by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research: 
(1) forward translation, (2) reconciliation and back translation, (3) cognitive 
debriefing, and (4) pilot testing. The psychometric properties of the translated 
version were evaluated by testing its internal consistency, construct validity, 
known-group validity and floor and ceiling effects. Patients who reported with 
or without trismus to the Head and Neck Oncology outpatient clinic were enrolled 
for the study. Comparison of the GTQ scores was done using Mann-Whitney U-test. 
The Pearson correlation coefficient was used for assessing convergent and 
divergent validity. Internal Consistency was calculated using Cronbach's alpha 
coefficient. The translated version of the GTQ 2 was administered to 60 patients 
(30 trismus patients and 30 non-trismus patients). GTQ 2 was successfully 
translated without any significant issues. Construct validity of the translated 
version was confirmed and it has a good internal consistency (α > 0.7). The 
translated instrument can differentiate between those with and without trismus 
(p < 0.0005). A valid and reliable Telugu version of the Gothenburg Trismus 
Questionnaire-2 is now available for the benefit of Indian patients.

neoplasm associated with a poor prognosis. It comprises 1-5% of all uterine 
malignancies but accounts for 16.4% of all deaths caused by uterine 
malignancies. There is a definite paucity of data available from the Indian 
subcontinent. Hence, we retrospectively conducted this study to analyze the 
clinical and pathological characteristics and outcomes of women with uterine 
carcinosarcoma in the past 10 years managed at the tertiary care center. This is 
a retrospective study of women with histologically proven uterine carcinosarcoma 
treated at a tertiary cancer center in South India between August 2009 and April 
2019. Inpatient and outpatient records were reviewed; clinicopathological data 
were collected; and follow-up and survival data were ascertained. Over a period 
of 10 years, 20 patients were diagnosed with uterine carcinosarcoma. The 
majority of patients were postmenopausal (80%). Post-menopausal bleeding was the 
main presenting complaint in about 80% of patients. More than two-thirds of 
patients presented in the early stage (stage I, 55%; stage II, 20%). All 
patients underwent staging laparotomy. Patients with good performance status 
(85%) received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy. At a 
median follow-up of 40 months, 7 (35%) patients were alive, out of which 6 are 
disease-free and 1 had a recurrence. The event-free survival at a median 
follow-up of 40 months was 40% and the overall survival was 48.5%. The outcome 
did not significantly differ based on the age, tumor histology (heterologous 
versus homologous), stage, and depth of myometrial invasion. Uterine 
carcinosarcoma, though rare, needs to be recognized as a distinct entity, and 
treated aggressively. Surgery is the cornerstone of therapy. Adjuvant concurrent 
chemoradiation and chemotherapy improve local control and may delay recurrence, 
but have shown little survival advantage. The optimal adjuvant treatment for 
this uncommon disease is yet to be established, highlighting the need for larger 
multicentric studies on this tumor.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical

commonest cause of cancer mortality among females. Advanced BC constitutes >70% 
of BC cases at initial presentation in India, among which locally advanced 
breast cancer (LABC) requires a multi-disciplinary approach with a combination 
of systemic and locoregional therapies. This descriptive hospital-based study 
was conducted over 1½ years after seeking approval from the institutional ethics 
committee. Fifty-five patients satisfying all the criteria of the study were 
enrolled. The data, thus, collected was pooled into Excel spreadsheet and 
analyzed using appropriate statistical tools. Most of the patients were 
postmenopausal, multiparous with breast lump being the commonest symptom. Mean 
baseline characteristics were age - 48 years, SUV max - 9.2, and Ki-67 - 17.8%. 
cT4 and cN2 were the commonest pre-NACT tumor and lymph node stage. Invasive 
ductal carcinoma was the commonest tumor type with the most common tumor grade 
being grade 3. Hormone receptor positivity and HER2 overexpression were seen in 
33 and 17 patients respectively. Post-NACT 32 patients underwent 
breast-conserving surgery. Pathological complete response (pCR), i.e., ypT0N0, 
was seen in 13 patients (23.6%). There was slight alteration in hormone receptor 
status, HER2 expression and Ki-67 in the post-NACT resected tumor. pCR, which is 
a surrogate marker for improved clinical outcome (DFS and OS) in LABC patients, 
occurred more commonly in patients with pre-NACT grade 3 tumors, high Ki-67, 
hormone receptor-negative, and HER2 overexpressing BC (overall, in triple 
negative BC) but was statistically significant only with Ki-67. Post-NACT, SUV

hospital is a tertiary referral center for cancer services in the city of 
Bangalore, India. A qualitative study by methodology, a focus group discussion 
was undertaken with the members of the head and neck tumor board. The results 
showed, in India, decision-making is predominantly led by the clinicians and the 
patient's family members. A number of factors play an important role in the 
decision-making process. These include as follows: health outcome measures 
(quality of life, health-related quality of life), clinician factors (knowledge, 
skill, expertise, judgment), patient factors (socio-economic, education, 
cultural), nursing factors, translational research, and resource infrastructure. 
Important themes and outcomes emerged from the qualitative study. As modern 
healthcare moves towards a patient-centered care approach, evidence-based 
patient choice and patient decision-making clearly have a greater role to play, 
and the cultural and practical issues demonstrated in this article must be 
considered.

with total mesorectal excision. Adding preoperative radiotherapy improved local 
control. The promising results of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy raised the hopes 
for conservative, yet oncologically safe management, probably using local 
excision technique. This study is a prospective comparative phase III study, 
where 46 rectal cancer patients were recruited from patients attending Oncology 
Centre of Mansoura University and Queen Alexandra Hospital Portsmouth University 
Hospital NHS with a median follow-up 36 months. The two recruited groups were as 
follows: group (A), 18 patients who underwent conventional radical surgery by 
TME; and group (B), 28 patients who underwent trans-anal endoscopic local 
excision. Patients of resectable low rectal cancer (below 10 cms from anal 
verge) with sphincter saving procedures were included: cT1-T3N0. The median 
operative time for LE was 120 min versus 300 in TME (p < 0.001), and median 
blood loss was 20 ml versus 100 ml in LE and TME, respectively (p < 0.001). 
Median hospital stay was 3.5 days versus 6.5 days (p = 0.009). No statistically 
significant difference in median DFS (64.2 months for LE versus 63.2 months for 
TME, p = 0.85) and median OS (72.9 months for LE versus 76.3 months for TME, 
p = 0.43). No statistically significant difference in LARS scores and QoL was 
observed between LE and TME (p = 0.798, p = 0.799). LE seems a good alternative 
to radical rectal resection in carefully selected responders to neoadjuvant 
therapy after thorough pre-operative evaluation, planning and patient 
counselling.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical

cystectomy alone will progress to metastatic disease. Surgery alone is not a 
sufficient therapy in a large number of patients with invasive bladder cancer. 
Systemic therapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been shown to provide 
response rates in several bladder cancer studies. There have been multiple 
randomized controlled studies undertaken to define further the effectiveness of 
neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in advance of cystectomy. In this 
study, we have retrospectively reviewed our series of patients who underwent 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive 
disease. Between Jan 2005 and Dec 2019, 72 patients underwent radical cystectomy 
following neoadjuvant chemotherapy over a 15-year period. The data was 
retrospectively collected and analyzed. The median age was 59.84 ± 8.967 years 
(range, 43 to 74), and the ratio of male to female patients was 5:1. Of the 72 
patients, 14 (19.44%) completed all the three cycles, 52 (72.22%) completed at 
least two cycles, and the remaining 6 (8.33%) completed only one cycle of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 36 (50%) patients died during the follow-up 
period. The mean and median survival of the patients was 84.85 ± 4.25 months and 
91.0 ± 5.83 months respectively. Neoadjuvant MVAC should be offered to patients 
with locally advanced bladder cancer and who are candidates for radical 
cystectomy. It is safe and effective in patients with adequate renal function.

effects, and appropriate intervention is necessary in the event of severe 
adverse effects.",© Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2021.,"DOI: 10.1007/s13193-021-01386-6

occult nodal metastasis (seen in 20-25% of cases), thus avoiding morbidity of 
prophylactic groin dissection in rest. Study was conducted between June 2016 and 
December 2019 on 42 patients (84 groins). Primary outcomes assessed were 
sensitivity, specificity, false negative rates, positive predictive value, and 
negative predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) compared to 
superficial inguinal node dissection (SIND). Secondary outcomes were to know 
prevalence of nodal metastasis, sensitivity, specificity, false negative rates, 
positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of frozen 
section study, and ultrasonography (USG) compared to 
histopathological examination (HPE) and to evaluate false negative results of 
fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Patients with impalpable inguinal nodes 
were subjected to USG and FNAC of suspicious nodes. Only those with 
non-suspicious USG/negative FNAC were included. Patients who were node positive, 
had prior chemotherapy/radiotherapy/prior groin surgery, or medically unfit for 
surgery were excluded. Dual-dye technique was used to identify sentinel node. 
Superficial inguinal dissection was done in all cases and both specimens were 
subject to frozen section. If ≥ 2 nodes were involved on frozen section, 
ilioinguinal dissection was done. SLNB had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, 
and accuracy of 100%, respectively. There were no false negative results of 
frozen section study among 168 specimens. Ultrasonography had sensitivity of 
50%, specificity of 48.75%, PPV of 4.65%, NPV of 95.12%, and accuracy of 48.81%. 
We had 2 false negative results of FNAC. Sentinel node biopsy with frozen

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a pre-invasive stage of cervical 
cancer, the major cause of which is human papillomavirus (HPV), and vaccination 
has a promising effect on reducing the progression of CIN lesions. The current 
study was a retrospective case control investigation in two centers, Shiraz and 
Sari Universities of Medical Sciences from 2018 to 2020 to evaluate the effect 
of quadrivalent HPV vaccination on CIN lesions (I, II, and III). Eligible 
patients diagnosed with CIN were selected and divided into two groups: one group 
received HPV vaccine and the control group did not. The patients were followed 
up after 12 and 24 months. The information about tests (e.g., Pap smear, 
colposcopy, and pathology biopsy) and history of vaccination was recorded and 
statistically analyzed. 150 patients were classified into the control group 
(without HPV vaccination) and the other 150 patients were in the Gardasil group 
(with HPV vaccination). The patients' mean age was 32 years old. Two groups were 
not significantly different according to age and CIN grades. Between two groups 
in 1 and 2 years' follow-up examinations, the high-grade lesions in both Pap 
smear and pathology were significantly diminished in patients in the HPV 
vaccinated group in comparison with the control group with p-values 0.001 and 
0.004 in 1 year follow-up respectively and 0.00 after 2 years follow-up. HPV 
vaccination can prevent the progression of CIN lesions in 2-year follow-up

or recurrence is pelvic exenteration. Some of the carefully selected patients 
with lesions of size less than 2 cm may be treated with radical hysterectomy. 
Patients treated by radical hysterectomy have less morbidity rates when compared 
to pelvic exenteration. The parameters for defining a subset of these patients 
have not been addressed. Given the changing scenario of organ preservation, we 
have to determine the role of radical hysterectomy after radical or defaulted 
radiotherapy treatment. Retrospective analysis of patients with post-irradiation 
cancer cervix with central residue or recurrence who were treated by surgery 
from 2012 to 2018 was done. The initial stage of the disease, radiation 
treatment details, recurrence/residue, extent of disease as per imaging, 
surgical findings, histopathological examination report, post-surgery local 
recurrence, distant recurrence and 2-year survival rates were analysed. A total 
of 45 patients were found eligible for the study from the database. Nine (20%) 
patients, who had tumours that were confined to cervix, size less than 2 cm with 
preserved planes of resection, underwent radical hysterectomy and the other 36 
(80%) patients underwent pelvic exenteration. Among patients who underwent 
radical hysterectomy, one (11.1%) patient had parametrial involvement and all of 
them had tumour-free resection margins. Among patients who underwent pelvic 
exenteration, 11 (30.6%) patients had parametrial involvement and five (13.9%) 
patients had tumour infiltrated resection margins. Among patients who were 
treated by radical hysterectomy, the local recurrence rate was high in patients 
who had a pretreatment FIGO stage of IIIB when compared to stage IIB (33.3% vs. 
20%). Out of the nine patients treated by radical hysterectomy, two patients had 
local recurrence and both of them did not receive brachytherapy preoperatively. 
In patients with an early stage carcinoma cervix with post-irradiation residue 
or recurrence, radical hysterectomy can be considered if the patient consents to 
participate in a trial, willing to be on strict follow-up and understands the 
postoperative complications. Large-scale studies for radical hysterectomy have 
to be done on post radical irradiation small volume early stage residue or 
recurrence, to identify the parameters for safe and comparable oncological 
outcomes.",© Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2021.,"DOI: 10.1007/s13193-021-01483-6

whether level V should be addressed or not. There is lot of heterogeneity in 
reporting of the management of level V in papillary thyroid cancer. We at our 
Institute address the lateral neck positive papillary thyroid cancer with 
selective neck dissection involving levels II-IV, performing extended level IV 
dissection with inclusion of the triangular area delineated by the 
sternocleidomastoid muscle, the clavicle, and the perpendicular line drawn to 
the clavicle from the point where the horizontal line at the level of cricoid 
cuts the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle. Retrospective analysis 
of the departmental data set related to thyroidectomy with lateral neck 
dissection from 2013 to mid-2019 for papillary thyroid cancer, was carried out. 
Patients with recurrent papillary thyroid cancer were excluded as were patients 
with involvement of level V. Data related to the demography of patients, 
histological diagnosis, and postoperative complications were compiled and 
summarized. Note was made of the incidence of ipsilateral neck recurrence and 
the neck level involved with recurrence noted. Data was analyzed for fifty-two 
patients of non-recurrent papillary thyroid cancer who had undergone total 
thyroidectomy and lateral neck dissection involving levels II-IV, with extended 
dissection at level IV. It should be noted that none of the patients had 
clinical involvement of level V. Only two patients had lateral neck recurrence, 
both the recurrences were in level III, one on the ipsilateral side and the 
other on the contralateral side. Recurrence in the central compartment was noted 
in two patients, with one of these patients also having ipsilateral level III

platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in the differential diagnosis of NIFTP. Pathology 
preparations of 209 patients with a follicular variant of papillary thyroid 
carcinoma (FVPTC) diagnosed after thyroid surgery in a tertiary health center 
between January 2010 and January 2020 were re-evaluated. Patients were divided 
into NIFTP and encapsulated follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(EFVPTC) to compare. Of the patients, 58 (27.7%) were NIFTP, and 151 (72.3%) 
were EFVPTC. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of age 
(p = 0.46), tumor size (p = 0.51), gender (p = 0.48), and surgical technique 
(p = 0.78) between the groups. The probability of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR) > 2 is more common in the EFVPTC group. It was statistically 
significant that the NIFTP group was 1.96 times more likely to have NLR > 2 (OR: 
1.96, 95% CI: 1.06-3.63) (p < 0.05). However, there was no risk difference 
between the groups in terms of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (OR: 0.76, 
95% CI: 0.41-1.43) (p > 0.05). The diagnosis of NIFTP should be kept in mind in 
the evaluation of patients whose thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy 
results are in the intermediate group. NIFTP exhibits better prognostic findings 
than classic thyroid papillary cancer and EFVPTC. Therefore, preoperative 
diagnosis of NIFTP in line with laboratory, ultrasonography, and FNA findings 
will save the patient from unnecessary overtreatment.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical

with intermediate-grade MEC parotid gland, which is very unusual below 10 years 
of age. A global literature search revealed only 3 other similar cases in 
children below 10 years of age. She presented with a 2-year history of left 
parotid gradually increasing hard swelling involving the overlying skin and 
underlying sternocleidomastoid muscle which was confirmed on a contrast-enhanced 
computed tomography (CECT) scan of the face and neck as well as a core biopsy to 
be a MEC left parotid. The patient underwent a left radical parotidectomy 
sacrificing the main trunk of the facial nerve while carefully preserving its 
distal branches along with a left selective neck dissection (SND) followed by 
facial reanimation using primary neurorrhaphy. Histopathology confirmed an 
intermediate-grade MEC pT4aN2bMx with close deep lobe margin warranting adjuvant 
radiotherapy. Albeit very rare, salivary gland neoplasms may occur in children

in the setting of a referral centre in a middle income (MDI) group country. A 
retrospective analysis of the case records of all patients of invasive breast 
cancer treated at our institute between January 2014 and December 2020 was done 
after obtaining approval from the Institute Ethics Committee (IEC). The number 
of patients seen, age, parity, menopausal status, family history of cancer, 
laterality, site of tumour in the breast, the symptomatology, clinical stage and 
presence or absence of metastases was the clinical parameters examined. The 
pathological stage and grade of the tumour, receptor status, treatment offered 
according to stage and the patterns of failure with respect to the surgery 
performed were recorded. Statistical analysis was a direct head to head 
comparison of the percentage proportions of the different variables. A total of 
685 patients of breast cancer were treated between January 2014 and December 
2020. A total of 53% of the cohort was more than 45 years old and 56.7% were 
post menopausal. A total of 58.8% of the patients presented with a cancer in the 
left breast and in the upper outer quadrant. Nearly 41% of the tumours were more 
than 4 cm in size. The most common receptor profile in our patient population 
was ER positive, PR positive and HER 2 negative. A total of 27.7% of the 
patients were offered neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and 63.06% underwent upfront 
surgery. A total of 19.7% of all surgeries performed (overall) were breast 
conservation surgeries (BCS). The use of BCS showed an increasing trend over the 
7 years studied rising from 16.79 to 25% (annually). The local failure rate for 
BCS was 11.8% but the incidence of distant metastases was not significantly 
different compared to the patients who underwent a mastectomy. Breast 
conservation is safe and feasible in a referral setting even in a middle income 
nation with multi-disciplinary treatment planning and needs to be adopted widely 
to preserve the body image and self esteem of patients with breast cancer.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical

represents an important alternative indicator which may benefit patient

non-neoplastic and neoplastic endometrial lesions and with the WHO grade of the 
tumours. Our study was a cross-sectional, observational study done in a tertiary 
care hospital from December 2019 to June 2021 on the hysterectomy sample of 50 
patients with a clinical history of abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain. 
The study showed strong positivity of HE4 in cases of endometrial carcinoma, 
weak positivity in cases of atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and negativity in 
cases of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia group. WHO grade 3(50%) and 
grade 2 (29%) endometrioid adenocarcinoma NOS in our study showed strong 
positivity for HE4 which was statistically significant (P value = 0.001). In 
recent studies using overexpression of HE4-related genes, the malignant 
biological behaviour such as cell adhesion, invasion, and proliferation was 
enhanced. It was seen in our study that strong positivity of HE4 was seen in all 
endometrial carcinoma groups and with higher WHO grade. So, HE4 may become a 
potential therapeutic target for advanced-stage endometrial carcinoma which 
requires further research. Thus, human epididymis-specific protein 4 (HE4) has 
been shown to be a promising marker for the detection of endometrial carcinoma 
patients who could be benefitted from targeted therapy.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical

univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and predictive nomogram was 
established based on these factors. Nomogram performance was measured using the 
C-index, calibration plots, and DCA. Patients were grouped by quartiles of 
nomogram scores and survival curves were plotted by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In 
total, 33,533 patients were included in the study. The nomogram contained 12 
prognostic factors in OS and 10 prognostic factors in LCSS. In the validation 
set, the C-index was 0.652 for predicting OS and 0.651 for predicting LCSS. The 
calibration curves for the nomogram-predicted probability of OS and LCSS showed 
good agreement between the actual observation and nomogram prediction. DCA 
indicated that the clinical value of the nomograms were higher than AJCC 8th 
stage for predicting OS and LCSS. Nomogram scores related risk stratification 
revealed statistically significant difference which have better discrimination

eligible studies, the model of random effects was used and the heterogeneity of 
studies was investigated with I2 index. Data analysis was performed with 
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 2). The total number of surveyed 
studies in patients with colorectal cancer was 22 studies. Based on the results 
of meta-analysis, the odds ratio of GG genotype in patients with colorectal 
cancer was 0.88. The odds ratio of GC genotype obtained in patients with 
colorectal cancer was 0.88 and the odds ratio of CC genotype in patients with 
colorectal cancer was 0.92. The total number of surveyed studies in patients 
with gastric cancer was 12. Based on the meta-analysis results, the odds ratio 
of GG genotype in patients with gastric cancer was 0.74, the odds ratio of GC 
genotype in patients with gastric cancer was 1.27, and the odds ratio of CC 
genotype in patients with gastric cancer was 0.78. The total number of surveyed

RAI-avid lung metastases and is clinically effective for lung metastatic 
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). We aim to investigate the association 
between the interval of RAI treatment and short-term response, and the side 
effects in patients with lung metastases from DTC and to identify predictors for 
non-effective response to the next RAI treatment.
METHODS: A total of 282 course pairs from 91 patients were established and 
categorized into two groups by the interval of neighboring RAI treatment (<12 
and ≥12 months), and the characteristics and treatment response between the two 
groups were compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify 
predictors associated with treatment response. The side effects in the former 
course and the latter course were compared while taking into account the 
interval.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two groups in treatment 
response in the latter course (p > 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, age ≥ 55 
years (OR = 7.29, 95% CI = 1.66-33.35, p = 0.008), follicular thyroid cancer (OR 
= 5.00, 95% CI = 1.23-22.18, p = 0.027), and a second RAI treatment as the 
former course (OR = 4.77, 95% CI = 1.42-18.61, p = 0.016) were significantly 
associated with a non-effective response. There was no significant difference in 
the side effects in the former and latter courses between the two groups (p > 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: The interval of RAI treatment does not affect short-term response 
and side effects of DTC patients with RAI-avid lung metastases. It was feasible 
to defer repeat evaluation and treatment with an interval of at least 12 months 
to obtain an effective response and reduce the risk of side effects.","Copyright © 2023 Wang, Shi, Huang, Liu and Tian.","DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2023.1117001

facilitate shared decision-making. Two important treatment decisions for 
patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), which could benefit from 
PtDAs, are as follows (1): the extent of surgery decision in patients with 
low-risk DTC and (2) the decision to start or delay starting the treatment with 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with advanced tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: PtDAs for these two decisions were developed using the 
International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) quality criteria in an 
iterative process of prototype development via alpha and beta testing by 
patients and physicians. The information content of the PtDAs was based on the 
available literature, current guidelines, and patient's needs, preferences, and 
values.
RESULTS: The web-based PtDAs underwent two rounds of alpha testing, revisions, 
and beta testing. The PtDAs have the same structure, consisting of six steps: a 
general introduction, information about the treatment options, comparing the 
treatment options, knowledge questions, a values clarification exercise, and 
saving the information. The alpha testing (n = 8 patients, n = 10 physicians) 
showed that the PtDAs were highly acceptable and usable for decision-making. 
Results of the beta testing in 20 patients showed that two patients did not use 
the PtDA; the other 18 patients found that the PtDAs were readable (n = 17) and 
helpful (n = 14) for decision-making. All patients recommend using the PtDAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based PtDAs were created for patients with DTC for two 
different treatment decisions. Our final version was judged to be clear, 
balanced, and helpful in decision-making.","Copyright © 2023 Koot, Hermens, Ottevanger, Netea-Maier, Stalmeier and the COMBO

differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) surgery. This study aimed to investigate 
whether patients complicated with radioiodine-avid (131I+) lymph nodes from DTC 
on the initial posttherapy scan (PTS) need repeated 131I therapy.
METHODS: From June 2013 to August 2022, DTC patients with 131I+ lymph nodes on 
the initial PTS who received at least two cycles of 131I therapy were 
retrospectively enrolled. They were divided into a complete response (CR) group 
and an incomplete response (IR) group according to their response to the initial 
131I therapy based on the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 170 DTC patients with 131I+ lymph nodes on the initial PTS 
were included; 42/170 (24.7%) patients were classified into the CR group and 
128/170 (75.9%) were classified into the IR group according to their response to 
the initial 131I therapy. None of the 42 CR patients had disease progression at 
the subsequent follow-up, and 37/170 (21.8%) IR patients improved after repeated 
therapy. Univariate analysis showed that N stage (P=0.002), stimulated 
thyroglobulin (sTg) level before initial 131I therapy (P<0.001), LNM size 
(P<0.001), number of total residual/recurrent LNM (P=0.021), radioiodine-nonavid 
(131I-) LNM (P=0.002) and ultrasound features (P<0.001) were related to the 
initial treatment response. On multivariate analysis, sTg level (OR=1.186, 
P<0.001) and LNM size (OR=1.533, P=0.004) were independent risk factors for IR 
after initial 131I therapy. The optimal sTg level and LNM size cutoff value for 
predicting the treatment response after initial 131I therapy were 18.2 µg/l and 
5mm.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested that approximately one-quarter of patients with 
131I+ lymph nodes on initial PTS, especially those with N0 or N1a stage, lower 
sTg level, smaller LNM size, ≤2 residual/recurrent LNMs, negative ultrasound 
features and no 131I- LNM, remain stable after one cycle of 131I therapy and do 
not need repeated therapy.","Copyright © 2023 Jiang, Liu, Qiu, Huo, Zhang, Cai, Lv and Ma.","DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2023.1099449

poses a risk factor for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The present study 
aimed to identify the key genes shared by HT and PTC for advancing the current 
understanding of their shared pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: HT- and PTC-related datasets (GSE138198 and GSE33630, respectively) 
were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Genes 
significantly related to the PTC phenotype were identified using weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were identified between PTC and healthy samples from GSE33630, and between HT 
and normal samples from GSE138198. Subsequently, functional enrichment analysis 
was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG). Transcription factors and miRNAs regulating the common genes in 
PTC and HT were forecasted using the Harmonizome and miRWalk databases, 
respectively, and drugs targeting these genes were investigated using the 
Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). The key genes in both GSE138198 and 
GSE33630 were further identified via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
analysis. The expression of key genes was verified in external validation set 
and clinical samples using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
RESULTS: In total, 690 and 1945 DEGs were associated with PTC and HT, 
respectively; of these, 56 were shared and exhibited excellent predictive 
accuracy in the GSE138198 and GSE33630 cohorts. Notably, four genes, Alcohol 
Dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B), Active BCR-related (ABR), alpha-1 antitrypsin 
(SERPINA1), and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5 (LPAR5) were recognized as key 
genes shared by HT and PTC. Subsequently, EGR1 was identified as a common 
transcription factor regulating ABR, SERPINA1, and LPAR5 expression. These 
findings were confirmed using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis.
CONCLUSION: Four (ADH1B, ABR, SERPINA1, and LPAR5) out of 56 common genes 
exhibited diagnostic potential in HT and PTC. Notably, this study, for the first 
time, defined the close relationship between ABR and HT/PTC progression. 
Overall, this study provides a basis for understanding the shared pathogenesis 
and underlying molecular mechanisms of HT and PTC, which might help improve 
patient diagnosis and prognosis.","Copyright © 2023 Liu, Yin, Wang, Li, Dong and Peng.","DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2023.1140094

hospitalized. Predicting factors affecting the hospital length of stay (LOS) can 
be effective in prioritizing patients, planning for services, and preventing the 
increase in LOS and death of patients. The present study aimed to identify the 
factors that predict LOS and mortality in COVID-19 patients in a retrospective 
cohort study.
METHODS: A total of 27,859 patients were admitted to 22 hospitals from February 
20, 2020 to June 21, 2021. The data collected from 12,454 patients were screened 
according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data were captured from 
the MCMC (Medical Care Monitoring Center) database. The study tracked patients 
until their hospital discharge or death. Hospital LOS and mortality were 
assessed as the study outcomes.
RESULTS: As the results revealed, 50.8% of patients were male and 49.2% were 
female. The mean hospital LOS of the discharged patients was 4.94. Yet, 9.1% of 
the patients (n = 1133) died. Among the predictors of mortality and long 
hospital LOS were the age above 60, admission to the ICU, coughs, respiratory 
distress, intubation, oxygen level less than 93%, cigarette and drug abuse, and 
a history of chronic diseases. Masculinity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and 
cancer were the effective variables in mortality, and positive CT was a factor 
significantly affecting the hospital LOS.
CONCLUSION: Paying special attention to high-risk patients and modifiable risk 
factors such as heart disease, liver disease, and other chronic diseases can 
diminish the complications and mortality rate of COVID-19. Providing training, 
especially for those who care for patients experiencing respiratory distress 
such as nurses and operating room personnel can improve the qualifications and 
skills of medical staff. Also, ensuring the availability of sufficient supply of 
medical equipment is strongly recommended.",© 2023 The Authors. Health Science Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/hsr2.1329

gastrointestinal malignancies. The geographical variation shows the influence of 
genetic factors, ethnicity, and distribution of various risk factors. Accurate 
knowledge of EC epidemiology at the global level will help to develop management 
strategies. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the global 
and regional disease burden of EC, including the incidence, mortality, and 
burden of this cancer in 2019.
METHODS: Incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) associated with EC in 204 countries in different 
classifications were extracted from the global burden of disease study. After 
collecting information on metabolic risks, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and body mass index (body mass 
index), the relationship between age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), 
mortality rate, and DALYs with these variables was determined.
RESULTS: In 2019, 534,563 new cases of EC were reported worldwide. The highest 
ASIR is related to regions with medium sociodemographic index (SDI), and high 
middle income according to the World Bank, the Asian continent, and the western 
Pacific region. In 2019, a total of 498,067 deaths from EC were recorded. The 
highest mortality rate due to ASR is in countries with medium SDI and countries 
with upper middle income of the World Bank. In 2019, 1,166,017 DALYs were 
reported due to EC. The ASIR, ASDR, and DALYS ASR of EC showed a significant 
negative linear correlation with SDI, metabolic risks, high FPG, high LDL 
cholesterol, and high BMI (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed significant gender and geographic

required. Tumour-associated microglia and macrophages promote glioblastoma 
growth in an immune-suppressed microenvironment. Most recurrences occur at the 
invasive margin of the surrounding brain, yet the relationships between 
microglia/macrophage phenotypes, T cells and programmed death-ligand 1 (an 
immune checkpoint) across human glioblastoma regions are understudied. In this 
study, we performed a quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of 15 markers of 
microglia/macrophage phenotypes (including anti-inflammatory markers triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 and CD163, and the low-affinity-activating 
receptor CD32a), T cells, natural killer cells and programmed death-ligand 1, in 
59 human IDH1-wild-type glioblastoma multi-regional samples (n = 177; 1 sample 
at tumour core, 2 samples at the margins: the infiltrating zone and leading 
edge). Assessment was made for the prognostic value of markers; the results were 
validated in an independent cohort. Microglia/macrophage motility and activation 
(Iba1, CD68), programmed death-ligand 1 and CD4+ T cells were reduced, and 
homeostatic microglia (P2RY12) were increased in the invasive margins compared 
with the tumour core. There were significant positive correlations between 
microglia/macrophage markers CD68 (phagocytic)/triggering receptor expressed on 
myeloid cells 2 (anti-inflammatory) and CD8+ T cells in the invasive margins but 
not in the tumour core (P < 0.01). Programmed death-ligand 1 expression was 
associated with microglia/macrophage markers (including anti-inflammatory) CD68, 
CD163, CD32a and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, only in the 
leading edge of glioblastomas (P < 0.01). Similarly, there was a positive 
correlation between programmed death-ligand 1 expression and CD8+ T-cell 
infiltration in the leading edge (P < 0.001). There was no relationship between 
CD64 (a receptor for autoreactive T-cell responses) and CD8+/CD4+ T cells, or 
between the microglia/macrophage antigen presentation marker HLA-DR and 
microglial motility (Iba1) in the tumour margins. Natural killer cell 
infiltration (CD335+) correlated with CD8+ T cells and with 
CD68/CD163/triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 anti-inflammatory 
microglia/macrophages at the leading edge. In an independent large glioblastoma 
cohort with transcriptomic data, positive correlations between anti-inflammatory 
microglia/macrophage markers (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, 
CD163 and CD32a) and CD4+/CD8+/programmed death-ligand 1 RNA expression were 
validated (P < 0.001). Finally, multivariate analysis showed that high 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, programmed death-ligand 1 and 
CD32a expression at the leading edge were significantly associated with poorer 
overall patient survival (hazard ratio = 2.05, 3.42 and 2.11, respectively), 
independent of clinical variables. In conclusion, anti-inflammatory 
microglia/macrophages, CD8+ T cells and programmed death-ligand 1 are correlated 
in the invasive margins of glioblastoma, consistent with immune-suppressive 
interactions. High triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, programmed 
death-ligand 1 and CD32a expression at the human glioblastoma leading edge are 
predictors of poorer overall survival. Given substantial interest in targeting 
microglia/macrophages, together with immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer, 
these data have major clinical implications.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

70-80% in iodine sufficient countries and up to 50% in iodine deficient 
countries. Combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors 
influences the development of GD. Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most 
common extra-thyroidal manifestation of GD with substantial impact on morbidity 
and quality of life. Expression of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) 
mRNA and protein in orbital tissues infiltrated by the activated lymphocytes 
produced by thyroid cells (Thyroid Receptor Antibody) results in the secretion 
of inflammatory cytokines that leads to the development of histological and

(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia.","OBJECTIVES: The traditional practice of empiric radioiodine (I-131) prescription 
is scientifically obsolete and inappropriate for inoperable metastatic 
differentiated thyroid cancer. However, theranostically guided prescription is 
still years away for many institutions. A personalized predictive method of 
radioiodine prescription that bridges the gap between empiric and theranostic 
methods is presented. It is an adaptation of the ""maximum tolerated activity"" 
method, where serial blood sampling is replaced by population kinetics carefully 
chosen by the user. It aims to maximize crossfire benefits within safety 
constraints to overcome tumour absorbed dose heterogeneity for a safe and 
effective first radioiodine fraction i.e., the First Strike.
METHODS: The EANM method of blood dosimetry was incorporated with population 
kinetics, marrow and lung safety constraints, body habitus and clinical 
assessment of metastatic extent. Population data of whole body and blood 
kinetics in patients with and without metastases, prepared by recombinant human 
thyroid stimulating hormone or thyroid hormone withdrawal, and the maximum safe 
marrow dose rate were deduced from published data. For diffuse lung metastases, 
the lung safety limit was linearly scaled by height and separated into lung and 
remainder-of-body components.
RESULTS: The slowest whole body Time Integrated Activity Coefficient (TIAC) 
amongst patients with any metastases was 33.5±17.0 h and the highest percentage 
of whole body TIAC attributed to blood was 16.6±7.9%, prepared by thyroid 
hormone withdrawal. A variety of other average radioiodine kinetics is 
tabulated. Maximum safe marrow dose rate was deduced to be 0.265 Gy/h per 
fraction, where blood TIAC is normalised to administered activity. An 
easy-to-use calculator was developed which only requires height, weight and 
gender to populate recommendations for personalized First Strike prescription. 
The user decides by clinical gestalt whether the prescription is to be 
constrained by marrow or lung, then selects an activity depending on how 
extensive the metastases are likely to be. A Standard Female with 
oligometastasis and good urine output without diffuse lung metastasis is 
expected to safely tolerate 8.03 GBq of radioiodine as the First Strike.
CONCLUSION: This predictive method will help institutions rationalise the First 
Strike prescription based on radiobiologically sound principles, personalised to 
individual circumstances.","PMCID: PMC10261697

RESULTS: 89Zr was produced with high radionuclidic and radiochemical purities 
(>99%) and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-Trastuzumab was prepared with radiochemical purity of 
>98% and specific activity of 9.85 GBq/µmol. The radioimmunoconjugate was stable 
both in PBS buffer and in human serum for at least 48 h. The radioimmunoactivity 
assay demonstrated about 70% of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-Trastuzumab is bound to the BT474 
cells at the number of 250×106 cells. Cell binding studies showed that about 28% 
of radioimmunoconjugate is attached to BT474 cells after 90 min. Internalization 
studies showed that 50% of [89Zr]Zr-Trastuzumab is internalized to BT474 cells 
only in 6 h. The biodistribution study of the labeled compound in normal mice 
demonstrated the same pattern of the monoclonal antibodies which is entirely 
different from the biodistribution of free 89Zr. Biodistribution and imaging 
studies in tumor-bearing mice showed the significant uptake values of 
[89Zr]Zr-Trastuzumab in tumor sites. [89Zr]Zr-Trastuzumab PET/CT revealed 
metastatic lesions documented previously with [18F]FDG PET/CT scan in a woman 
with breast cancer who was under treatment with Herceptin. Although the [18F]FDG 
PET/CT scan had better quality images, the valuable and unique advantage of 
[89Zr]Zr-Trastuzumab PET/CT is delineating HER2+ metastasis, which is essential 
in diagnosis and HER2-based treatments.
CONCLUSION: The prepared [89Zr]Zr-Trastuzumab has a high potential 
radio-pharmaceutical for immune-PET imaging of the patients with HER2+ tumors.","DOI: 10.22038/AOJNMB.2022.68093.1471

pretreatment Positron emission tomography / computed tomography using 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET/CT) in cervical cancer according to two major 
histologic types.
METHODS: Eighty-three squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients and 35 
adenocarcinoma (AC) patients who underwent pretreatment FDG-PET/CT were 
retrospectively analyzed. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean 
standardized uptake value (SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total 
lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the primary tumor were calculated. Kaplan-Meier 
analyses were used to compare correlations between each PET parameter and 
overall survival (OS). The prognostic values of imaging and clinical parameters 
were assessed using uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: SUVmax, SUVmean, and TLG were significantly higher in SCC than in AC 
(p<0.01 each). No significant difference in MTV was seen between the two groups 
(p=0.10). As for Kaplan-Meier analyses, in SCC, patients with SUVmax, SUVmean, 
MTV, and TLG exceeding cutoff values tended to show worse OS than patients with 
lower values (p=0.07, p=0.27, p<0.01, and p=0.01, respectively, for OS). On the 
other hand, in AC, patients with MTV and TLG exceeding cutoff values showed 
significantly worse PFS and OS (p<0.01 each for OS), while SUVmax and SUVmean 
were unrelated to OS (p=0.91 and p=0.83, respectively for OS). As for 
multivariable analyses, in SCC, TLG was identified as an independent prognostic 
factor for OS (p=0.01). In AC, MTV was identified as an independent prognostic 
factor for OS (p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that FDG-PET/CT would be useful for 
predicting prognosis in cervical cancer, although the clinical significance of 
quantitative values may differ according to histopathological type.","DOI: 10.22038/AOJNMB.2023.69159.1481

oncogenic driver in glioblastoma (GBM), efforts to therapeutically target this 
protein have been largely unsuccessful. The present preclinical study evaluated 
the novel EGFR inhibitor WSD-0922.
METHODS: We employed flank and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models to 
characterize WSD-0922 and compare its efficacy to erlotinib, a potent EGFR 
inhibitor that failed to provide benefit for GBM patients. We performed 
long-term survival studies and collected short-term tumor, plasma, and 
whole-brain samples from mice treated with each drug. We utilized mass 
spectrometry to measure drug concentrations and spatial distribution and to 
assess the impact of each drug on receptor activity and cellular signaling 
networks.
RESULTS: WSD-0922 inhibited EGFR signaling as effectively as erlotinib in in 
vitro and in vivo models. While WSD-0922 was more CNS penetrant than erlotinib 
in terms of total concentration, comparable concentrations of both drugs were 
measured at the tumor site in orthotopic models, and the concentration of free 
WSD-0922 in the brain was significantly less than the concentration of free 
erlotinib. WSD-0922 treatment provided a clear survival advantage compared to 
erlotinib in the GBM39 model, with marked suppression of tumor growth and most 
mice surviving until the end of the study. WSD-0922 treatment preferentially 
inhibited phosphorylation of several proteins, including those associated with 
EGFR inhibitor resistance and cell metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: WSD-0922 is a highly potent inhibitor of EGFR in GBM, and warrants 
further evaluation in clinical studies.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press, the Society for

from the epithelial cells of the biliary tree and the gallbladder. They are 
often locally advanced or already metastatic at the time of the diagnosis and 
therefore prognosis remains dismal. Unfortunately, the management of BTCs has 
been limited by resistance and consequent low response rate to cytotoxic 
systemic therapy. New therapeutic approaches are needed to improve the survival 
outcomes for these patients. Immunotherapy, one of the newest therapeutic 
options, is changing the approach to the oncological treatment. Immune 
checkpoint inhibitors are by far the most promising group of immunotherapeutic 
agents: they work by blocking the tumor-induced inhibition of the immune 
cellular response. Immunotherapy in BTCs is currently approved as second-line 
treatment for patients whose tumors have a peculiar molecular profile, such as 
high levels of microsatellites instability, PD-L1 overexpression, or high levels 
of tumor mutational burden. However, emerging data from ongoing clinical trials 
seem to suggest that durable responses can be achieved in other subsets of 
patients. The BTCs are characterized by a highly desmoplastic microenvironment 
that fuels the growth of cancer tissue, but tissue biopsies are often difficult 
to obtain or not feasible in BTCs. Recent studies have hence proposed to use 
liquid biopsy approaches to search the blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to use as biomarkers in BTCs. So far studies are 
insufficient to promote their use in clinical management, however trials are 
still in progress with promising preliminary results. Analysis of blood samples 
for ctDNA to research possible tumor-specific genetic or epigenetic alterations 
that could be linked to treatment response or prognosis was already feasible. 
Although there are still few data available, ctDNA analysis in BTC is fast, 
non-invasive, and could also represent a way to diagnose BTC earlier and monitor 
tumor response to chemotherapy. The prognostic capabilities of soluble factors 
in BTC are not yet precisely determined and more studies are needed. In this 
review, we will discuss the different approaches to immunotherapy and tumor 
circulating factors, the progress that has been made so far, and the possible 
future developments.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/ijms.82008

oncogene in several cancers, but the function and its mechanism of MIR155HG in 
gastric cancer (GC) is still poorly understood. In this study, we determined the 
biological functions and underlying mechanisms of MIR155HG in GC cells. We found 
that expression levels of MIR155HG was increased markedly in GC patients' serum. 
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that MIR155HG modulated the malignant 
phenotype of GC cells, such as cell proliferation, colony forming ability, cell 
migration ability, and tumor growth in nude mice. Next, our results revealed 
that NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways could be involved in regulating the 
malignant behavior of GC cells. Our rescue experiments showed that inhibiting 
NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways attenuated the phenotypes caused by MIR155HG 
overexpression. Moreover, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays revealed 
overexpression of MIR155HG reduced the apotosis of GC cells induced by cisplatin

plays an important role in diverse biological functions through the epigenetic 
regulation of gene transcription, especially in cancer development. However, its 
involvement in human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) has not been elucidated yet. 
Here we demonstrated that DPY30 was overexpressed in CRC tissues, and 
significantly associated with pathological grading, tumor size, TNM stage, and 
tumor location. Furthermore, DPY30 knockdown remarkably suppressed the CRC cell 
proliferation through downregulation of PCNA and Ki67 in vitro and in vivo, 
simultaneously induced cell cycle arrest at S phase by downregulating Cyclin A2. 
In the mechanistic study, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that enriched gene ontology 
of cell proliferation and cell growth was significantly affected. And ChIP 
result indicated that DPY30 knockdown inhibited H3 lysine 4 trimethylation 
(H3K4me3) and attenuated interactions between H3K4me3 with PCNA, Ki67 and cyclin 
A2 respectively, which led to the decrease of H3K4me3 establishment on their 
promoter regions. Taken together, our results demonstrate overexpression of 
DPY30 promotes CRC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by facilitating 
the transcription of PCNA, Ki67 and cyclin A2 via mediating H3K4me3. It suggests 
that DPY30 may serve as a potential therapeutic molecular target for CRC.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/ijms.80073

poor prognosis. Therefore, further research is needed on its potential 
pathogenesis and therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, the relevant 
datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database and the key modules were 
identified using WGCNA in the necroptosis-related gene set, while single-cell 
datasets were scored using the necroptosis gene set. Differential genes in the 
high- and low-expression groups were determined using the WGCNA module genes as 
intersection sets to identify key genes involved in necroptosis in liver cancer. 
Then, prognostic models were constructed using LASSO COX regression followed by 
multi-faceted validation. Finally, model genes were found to be correlated with 
key proteins of the necroptosis pathway and used to identify the most relevant 
genes, followed by their experimental validation. Subsequently, on the basis of 
the analysis results, the most relevant SFPQ was selected for cell-level 
verification. Results: We constructed a prognosis model that included five 
necroptosis-related genes (EHD1, RAC1, SFPQ, DAB2 and PABPC4) to predict the 
prognosis and survival of HCC patients. The results showed that the prognosis 
was more unfavorable in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group, 
which was corroborated using ROC curves and risk factor plots. In addition, we 
further checked the differential genes using GO and KEGG analyses and found that 
they were predominantly enriched in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction 
pathway. The results of the GSVA analysis demonstrated that the high-risk group 
was mainly enriched in DNA replication, regulation of the mitotic cycle, and 
regulation of various cancer pathways, while the low-risk group was 
predominantly enriched in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics using 
cytochrome P450. SFPQ was found to be the main gene that affects the prognosis 
and SFPQ expression was positively correlated with the expression of RIPK1, 
RIPK3 and MLKL. Furthermore, the suppression of SFPQ could inhibit 
hyper-malignant phenotype HCC cells, while the WB results showed that inhibition 
of SFPQ expression also resulted in lower expression of necroptosis proteins, 
compared to the sh-NC group. Conclusions: Our prognostic model could accurately 
predict the prognosis of patients with HCC to further identify novel molecular 
candidates and interventions that can be used as alternative methods of 
treatment for HCC.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/ijms.79274

involved in various processes, including the cell cycle, VEGF pathway, immune 
system processes, and biogenesis of ribonucleoproteins. MCM10, TPX2, PRC1, and 
KIF11 were identified as key genes closely related to FANCI and poor prognosis. 
A reliable five-variable prognostic model was constructed with strong predictive 
capability. Lastly, a positive correlation was observed between FANCI expression 
and tumor-infiltration levels of CD8+ T cells, B cells, regulatory T (Tregs), 
CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2), and macrophage M2 cells. Conclusion: FANCI may hold 
promise as a potential biomarker for predicting prognostic outcomes, and a 
valuable therapeutic target for LIHC patients, with a focus on 
anti-proliferation, anti-chemoresistance, and combination with immunotherapy.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/ijms.83760

parameter recently deployed in predicting various cancers. This study aimed to 
evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in patients with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: We conducted a 
retrospective study of 745 patients with HBV-related HCC, 253 patients with 
chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 256 healthy individuals to compare their 
hematological parameters and analyze their RDW levels. Potential risk factors 
for long-term all-cause mortality in patients with HBV-related HCC were 
predicted using Multivariate Cox regression. A nomogram was generated, and its 
performance was evaluated. Results: The RDW of patients with HBV-related HCC was 
significantly higher than that of those with CHB and healthy controls. In the 
former, splenomegaly, liver cirrhosis, larger tumor diameter, multiple tumor 
number, portal vein tumor thrombus, and lymphatic or distant metastasis were 
significantly increased, and the later the Child-Pugh grade and Barcelona clinic 
liver cancer stage, the higher the RDW. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression 
analysis identified RDW as an independent risk factor for predicting long-term 
all-cause mortality in patients with HBV-related HCC. Finally, we successfully 
generated a nomogram incorporating RDW and validated its predictive ability. 
Conclusions: RDW is a potentially valuable hematological marker for predicting 
the survival and prognosis of patients with HBV-related HCC. The nomogram 
incorporating RDW can be used as an effective tool to plan the individualized 
treatment of such patients.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/ijms.79619

outside the uterus and is associated with an inflammatory immune response. The 
gut and reproductive tract microbiota constitute a protective barrier against 
infection by pathogens and regulate inflammatory and immune functions. This 
review summarizes microbiota imbalance (i.e., dysbiosis) in endometriosis and 
discusses how dysbiosis influences disease development. The literature was 
searched for studies published from inception to March 2022 in the PubMed and 
Google Scholar databases using a combination of specific terms. An altered gut 
and reproductive tract microbiome has been reported in numerous conditions, such 
as inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, autoimmunity, cancer and reproductive 
disorders (e.g., endometriosis). Furthermore, microbial dysbiosis is a hallmark 
of endometriosis and is characterized by a decrease in beneficial probiotics and 
an increase in pathogenic microbes, which leads to a series of estrobolomic and 
metabolomic changes. Gut or reproductive tract microbiome dysbiosis was reported 
in mice, nonhuman primates, and females with endometriosis. Animal models of 
endometriosis demonstrated the effects of the gut microbiome on lesion growth 
and vice versa. The immune system mediated by the microbiota-gut-reproductive 
tract axis triggers an inflammatory response that damages reproductive tract 
tissue, which possibly leads to endometriosis. However, whether the alteration 
of eubiosis (a balanced microbiota) to dysbiosis is a cause or a result of 
endometriosis is unclear. In conclusion, this review provides an overview of the 
relationship between the gut and reproductive tract microbiome and 
endometriosis, focusing on the mechanisms by which dysbiosis may increase the 
risk of disease.",Copyright: © Kobayashi.,"DOI: 10.3892/br.2023.1626

effect of fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid, in combination with gemcitabine on 
pancreatic cancer cells. MTT assays and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry 
were performed to study the mechanism of action. The results revealed that 
combining a low dose of fucoxanthin with gemcitabine enhanced the cell viability 
of human embryonic kidney cells, 293, while a high dose of fucoxanthin enhanced 
the inhibitory effect of gemcitabine on the cell viability of this cell line. In 
addition, the enhanced effect of fucoxanthin on the inhibitory effect of 
gemcitabine on PANC-1 cells was significant (P<0.01). Fucoxanthin combined with 
gemcitabine also exerted significant enhancement of the anti-proliferation 
effect in MIA PaCa-2 cells in a concentration dependent manner (P<0.05), 
compared with gemcitabine treatment alone. In conclusion, fucoxanthin improved 
the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine on human pancreatic cancer cells at 
concentrations that were not cytotoxic to non-cancer cells. Thus, fucoxanthin

independent prognostic factor in multiple cancers. However, the impact of 
marital status on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients was still highly 
controversial.
METHOD: All NSCLC patients diagnosed between 2010-2016 were selected from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. To control the 
confounding effect of related clinicopathological characteristics, propensity 
score matching (PSM) was conducted between married and unmarried groups. In 
addition, independent prognostic clinicopathological factors were evaluated via 
Cox proportional hazard regression. Moreover, nomograms were established based 
on the clinicopathological characteristics, and the predictive accuracy was 
assessed by calibration curves. Furthermore, decision curve analysis (DCA) was 
used to determine the clinical benefits.
RESULTS: In total, 58,424 NSCLC patients were enrolled according to the 
selection criteria. After PSM, 20,148 patients were selected into each group for 
further analysis. The married group consistently demonstrated significantly 
better OS and CSS compared to unmarried group [OS median survival (95% CI): 25 
(24-26) vs. 22 (21-23) months, p < 0.001; CSS median survival (95% CI): 31 
(30-32) vs. 27 (26-28) months, p < 0.001]. Moreover, single patients were 
associated with the worst OS [median survival (95% CI): 20 (19-22) months] and 
CSS [median survival (95%CI): 24 (23-25) months] among unmarried subgroups. 
Besides, unmarried patients had a significantly worse prognosis compared to 
married patients in both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regressions. Furthermore, married group was associated with better survival in 
most subgroups. To predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS and CSS probabilities, 
nomograms were established based on age, race, sex, gender, marital status, 
histology, grade, TNM stage. The C-index for OS and CSS were 0.759 and 0.779. 
And the calibration curves showed significant agreement between predictive risk 
and the observed probability. DCA indicated nomograms had consistently better 
predict performance.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that unmarried NSCLC patients were 
associated with significantly worse OS and CSS compared to married NSCLC 
patients. Therefore, unmarried patients need not only closer surveillance, but 
also more social and family support, which may improve patients' adherence and 
compliance, and eventually improve the survival.","Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Zhang, Yang, Huang, Lin, Wen, Wang, Guo and Zhang.","DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1136877

stakeholders involved in the development of drugs, including academic 
researchers. In recent years, EMA has collaborated more closely with academia, 
inter alia by taking part in external research projects such as those set up 
under the Horizon 2020 program in general and the Innovative Medicines 
Initiative in particular. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perceived 
added value of EMA's involvement in these projects, both from the perspective of 
the Agency's participating Scientific Officers and of the coordinators of the 
consortia that undertook them.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the coordinators of 21 
ongoing or recently finalized projects in which EMA has participated, as well as 
with the Agency experts contributing to them.
RESULTS: In total, 40 individuals were interviewed, of whom 23 were project 
coordinators and 17 were EMA staff members. While most of the projects were 
reported to suffer from delays due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the consortia 
adapted to the circumstances and their members still expected to deliver on 
their objectives. EMA's input into the projects ranged from providing guidance 
by reviewing documents and attending meetings to creating project materials and 
disseminating them. The frequency of communication between EMA and the consortia 
varied widely. The projects generated a diverse set of outputs, which 
encompassed new or improved medicinal products, methodological standards, 
research infrastructures, and educational tools. All of the coordinators 
expressed that EMA's contributions to their projects had increased the 
scientific relevance of their consortium's work, and the EMA experts found that 
the knowledge and the deliverables produced by the projects were valuable, 
taking into consideration the time they had invested into them. In addition, 
interviewees highlighted some actions which could be taken to increase the 
regulatory significance of the project outcomes.
CONCLUSION: EMA's engagement in external research projects benefits the

treatment that engages the patient's immune system to fight certain 
hematological malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In 
the European Union (EU), CAR T-cell therapies have been approved for 
relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL patients since 2018, but patient access is often 
still limited or delayed. This paper is aimed at discussing challenges to access 
and possible solutions in the largest four EU countries.
METHODS: The analysis relied on literature review, market data collection, since 
homogeneous data coming from registries were not available, and discussion with 
experts coming from all four countries.
RESULTS: We calculated that in 2020, between 58% and 83% of R/R DLBCL patients 
(EMA approved label population) or between 29% and 71% of the estimated 
medically eligible R/R DLBCL patients, were not treated with a licensed CAR 
T-cell therapy. Common challenges along the patient journey that may result in 
limited access or delays to CAR T-cell therapy were identified. These include 
timely identification and referral of eligible patients, pre-treatment funding 
approval by authorities and payers, and resource needs at CAR T-cell centers.
DISCUSSION: These challenges, existing best practices and recommended focus 
areas for health systems are discussed here, with the aim to inform necessary 
actions for overcoming patient access challenges for current CAR T-cell 
therapies as well as for future cell and gene therapies.","Copyright © 2023 Canales Albendea, Canonico, Cartron, Deiters, Jommi, Marks,

of minimally invasive surgery [MIS, including robotic-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery (RATS) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)] and open 
thoracotomy (OT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with N2 
disease.
METHODS: We searched online databases and studies from the creation of the 
database to August 2022, comparing the MIS group to the OT group for NSCLC with 
N2 disease. Study endpoints included intraoperative outcomes [e.g., conversion, 
estimated blood loss (EBL), surgery time (ST), total lymph nodes (TLN), and R0 
resection], postoperative outcomes [e.g., length of stay (LOS) and 
complication], and survival outcomes [e.g., 30-day mortality, overall survival 
(OS), and disease-free survival (DFS)]. We estimated outcomes using random 
effects meta-analysis to account for studies with high heterogeneity (I2 > 50 or 
p < 0.05). Otherwise, we used a fixed-effect model. We calculated odds ratios 
(ORs) for binary outcomes and standard mean differences (SMDs) for continuous 
outcomes. Treatment effects on OS and DFS were described by hazard ratio (HR).
RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies on MIS vs. OT 
for NSCLC with N2 disease included 8,374 patients. Compared to OT, patients that 
underwent MIS had less estimated blood loss (EBL) (SMD = - 64.82, p < 0.01), 
shorter length of stay (LOS) (SMD = -0.15, p < 0.01), higher R0 resection rate 
(OR = 1.22, p = 0.049), lower 30-day mortality (OR = 0.67, p = 0.03), and longer 
overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.61, P < 0.01). The results showed no statistically 
significant differences in surgical time (ST), total lymph nodes (TLN), 
complications, and disease-free survival (DFS) between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Current data suggest that minimally invasive surgery may provide 
satisfying outcomes, a higher R0 resection rate, and better short-term and 
long-term survival than open thoracotomy.

destroy cancer cells during thermal neutron irradiation. To selectively 
eliminate cancer cells but avoid harmful effects on normal tissues, novel 
boron-peptide conjugates with angiopep-2, namely ANG-B, were constructed and 
evaluated in preclinical settings. Boron-peptide conjugates were synthesized 
using solid-phase peptide synthesis, and the molecular mass was validated by 
mass spectrometry afterwards. Boron concentrations in 6 cancer cell lines and an 
intracranial glioma mouse model after treatments were analyzed by inductively 
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Phenylalanine (BPA) was 
tested in parallel for comparison. In vitro treatment with boron delivery 
peptides significantly increased boron uptake in cancer cells. BNCT with 5 mM 
ANG-B caused 86.5% ± 5.3% of clonogenic cell death, while BPA at the same 
concentration caused 73.3% ± 6.0% clonogenic cell death. The in vivo effect of 
ANG-B in an intracranial glioma mouse model was evaluated by PET/CT imaging at 
31 days after BNCT. The mouse glioma tumours in the ANG-B-treated group were 
shrunk by 62.9% on average, while the BPA-treated tumours shrank by only 23.0%. 
Therefore, ANG-B is an efficient boron delivery agent, which has low 
cytotoxicity and high tumour-to-blood ratio. Based on these experimental 
results, we expected that ANG-B may leverage BNCT performance in clinical 
applications in future.","Copyright © 2023 Xiang, Ma, Tong, Zuo, Hu, Luo, Liu, Liang, Ren and Liu.","DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1199881

in human cancers; however, their role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is unknown.
METHODS: Firstly, consensus clustering analysis was used to identify PcG 
patterns among the 633 LUAD samples in the training dataset. The PcG patterns 
were then compared in terms of the overall survival (OS), signaling pathway 
activation, and immune cell infiltration. The PcG-related gene score (PcGScore) 
was developed using Univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm to estimate the prognostic value and 
treatment sensitivity of LUAD. Finally, the prognostic ability of the model was 
validated using a validation dataset.
RESULTS: Two PcG patterns were obtained by consensus clustering analysis, and 
the two patterns showed significant differences in prognosis, immune cell 
infiltration, and signaling pathways. Both the univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses confirmed that the PcGScore was a reliable and independent 
predictor of LUAD (P<0.001). The high- and low-PCGScore groups showed 
significant differences in the prognosis, clinical outcomes, genetic variation, 
immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic effects. 
Lastly, the PcGScore demonstrated exceptional accuracy in predicting the OS of 
the LUAD patients in a validation dataset (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the PcGScore could serve as a novel 
biomarker to predict prognosis, clinical outcomes, and treatment sensitivity for 
LUAD patients.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-22-1324

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: It has been reported that twinfilin actin binding protein 1 (TWF1) 
is associated with the progression of breast and pancreatic cancers. However, 
the roles and mechanisms of TWF1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have not been 
reported.
METHODS: The expression levels of TWF1 in LUAD and normal tissues were analyzed 
using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and validation was carried out 
with 12 clinical samples. The relationship between TWF1 expression and LUAD 
patients' clinical indices and immunity was investigated. Cell Counting Kit-8 
(CCK-8) and migration and invasion assays were employed to explore the effects 
of downregulated TWF1 on LUAD cell proliferation and metastasis.
RESULTS: TWF1 was upregulated in LUAD tissues, and upregulated TWF1 was 
correlated with the tumor (T) stage, node (N) stage, clinical classification, 
overall survival (OS), and progression-free interval (PFI) of LUAD patients. 
Moreover, the Cox regression analysis showed that TWF1 overexpression was an 
independent risk factor for the poor prognosis of LUAD patients. TWF1 expression 
was associated with tumor immune infiltration (such as dendritic cells resting, 
eosinophils, macrophages M0, and others), drug sensitivity (such as A-770041, 
Bleomycin, and BEZ235), tumor mutation burden (TMB), and sensitivity to 
immunotherapy. In the cell model, TWF1 expression interference significantly 
prohibited LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which might be 
relevant to aberrant MMP1 protein downregulation.
CONCLUSIONS: TWF1 overexpression was correlated with poor prognoses and immune 
status of LUAD patients. Inhibited TWF1 expression delayed the growth and 
migration of cancer cells by downregulating MMP protein, implying that TWF1 is a 
promising biomarker for the prognoses of LUAD patients.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-23-395

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a high mortality rate and 
poor prognosis. The early detection of high-risk patients is essential to 
improve patient prognosis. Thus, the identification of a non-invasive, 
non-radiative, convenient, and fast diagnostic approach should be a top priority 
in NSCLC research. Circulating extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in the plasma are 
potential biomarkers for NSCLC.
METHODS: We used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to explore the 
NSCLC-related RNAs, especially the circular RNAs (circRNAs). The 
circRNA-targeted micro RNAs (miRNAs) were predicted using 3 circRNA databases 
[i.e., the Cancer-Specific CircRNA Database (CSCD), circBank, and Circular RNA 
Interactome]. The circRNA-miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) network was constructed 
using Cytoscape V3.8.0 (Cytoscape Consortium, San Diego, CA, USA). The 
expression levels of some differentially expressed genes were validated by a 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis.
RESULTS: The results showed that the RNA biotypes of the mitochondrial ribosomal 
RNAs (mt-rRNAs) and mitochondrial transfer RNAs (mt-tRNAs) were upregulated in 
the NSCLC plasma. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) terms of the differentially expressed transcripts of NSCLC 
included oxidative phosphorylation, proton transmembrane transport, and the 
response to oxidative stress. Additionally, the qRT-PCR validation indicated 
that hsa_circ_0000722 had significantly higher expression in the NSCLC plasma 
than the control plasma, but hsa_circ_0006156 did not differ between the NSCLC 
plasma and the control plasma. The expression levels of miR-324-5p and miR-326 
were higher in the NSCLC plasma than the control plasma.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an exRNA-sequencing strategy was used to identify 
the expression of NSCLC-specific transcription factors in clinical plasma 
samples, and hsa_circ_0000722 and hsa-miR-324-5p were identified as potential 
biomarkers in NSCLC.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-23-517

and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, USA.","BACKGROUND: Some patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have superior 
short- and long-term outcomes with sleeve lobectomy rather than pneumonectomy. 
Originally sleeve lobectomy was reserved for patients with limited pulmonary 
function, however, the reported superior results allowed sleeve lobectomy to be 
performed in expanded patient populations. In a further attempt to improve 
post-operative outcomes surgeons have adopted minimally invasive techniques 
Minimally invasive approaches have potential benefits to patients such as 
decreased morbidity and mortality while maintaining the same caliber of 
oncologic outcomes.
METHODS: We identified patients at our institution who underwent sleeve 
lobectomy or pneumonectomy to treat NSCLC from 2007 to 2017. We analyzed these 
groups in respect to 30- and 90-day mortality, complications, local recurrence, 
and median survival. We included multivariate analysis to determine the impact 
of a minimally invasive approach, sex, extent of resection, and histology. 
Differences in mortality were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method using the 
log-rank test to compare the groups. A two-tailed Z test for difference in 
proportions was done to analyze complications, local recurrence, 30-day and 
90-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 108 patients underwent sleeve lobectomy (n=34) or 
pneumonectomy (n=74) for treatment of NSCLC with 18 undergoing open 
pneumonectomy, 56 undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) 
pneumonectomy, 29 undergoing open sleeve lobectomy, and 5 undergoing VATS sleeve 
lobectomy. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (P=0.064) but 
there was a difference in 90-day (P=0.007). There was no difference in 
complication rates (P=0.234) or local recurrence rates (P=0.779). The 
pneumonectomy patients had a median survival of 23.6 months (95% CI: 3.8-43.4 
months). The sleeve lobectomy group had a median survival of 60.7 months (95% 
CI: 43.3-78.2 months) (P=0.008). On multivariate analysis extent of resection 
(P<0.001) and tumor stage (P=0.036) were associated with survival. There was no 
significant difference between the VATS approach and the open surgical approach 
(P=0.053).
CONCLUSIONS: When considering patients undergoing surgery for NSCLC sleeve 
lobectomy resulted in lower 90-day mortality and better 3-year survival compared 
to patients undergoing PN. Having a sleeve lobectomy rather than a pneumonectomy 
and having earlier-stage disease lead to significantly improved survival on 
multivariate analysis. Having a VATS operation leads to a non-inferior 
post-operative outcome compared to open surgery.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-22-654

0.56-0.81) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.47-0.89), respectively. Regarding gene set 
enrichment analysis (GSEA) pathways, the G2-M checkpoint pathway was predicted 
with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69-0.90). Regarding markers of immunotherapy 
response, intratumoral tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (iTILs), stromal 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs), CD8A, and PDCD1 were predicted with AUCs 
of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.55-1.00), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.65-0.87), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60-0.82),

integration of clinical prognostic variables and deep features of images can 
improve the stratification of patient prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a deep-learning-based workflow, we developed models to 
predict the clinicopathological features, multi-omics features and prognosis of

cancer patients and family caregivers (FCGs) have unmet quality of life (QOL) 
needs. An understudied topic in lung cancer research is the role of social 
determinants of health (SDOH) on QOL outcomes for this population. The purpose 
of this review was to explore the state of research on SDOH FCGs centered 
outcomes in lung cancer.
METHODS: The databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and American Psychological Association 
(APA) PsycInfo were searched for peer-reviewed manuscripts evaluating defined 
SDOH domains on FCGs published within the last ten years. The information 
extracted using Covidence included patients, FCGs and study characteristics. 
Level of evidence and quality of articles were assessed using the Johns Hopkins 
Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Rating Scale.
RESULTS: Of the 344 full-text articles assessed, 19 were included in this 
review. The social and community context domain focused on caregiving stressors 
and interventions to reduce its effects. The health care access and quality 
domain showed barriers and underuse of psychosocial resources. The economic 
stability domain indicated marked economic burdens for FCGs. Four interconnected 
themes emerged among articles on the influence of SDOH on FCG-centered outcomes 
in lung cancer: (I) psychological well-being, (II) overall quality of life, 
(III) relationship quality, and (IV) economic hardship. Notably, most 
participants in the studies were White females. The tools used to measure SDOH 
factors included primarily demographic variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Current studies provide evidence on the role of SDOH factors on 
lung cancer FCGs' QOL. Expanded utilization of validated SDOH measures in future 
studies would provide greater consistency in data, that could in turn inform 
interventions to improve QOL. Further research focusing on the domains of 
education quality and access and neighborhood and built environment should be 
carried out to bridge gaps in knowledge.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-22-1613

and lung cancer. The association between obesity and lung cancer risk/prognosis 
varies depending on age, gender, race, and the metric used to quantify 
adiposity. Increased body mass index (BMI) is counterintuitively associated with 
decreased lung cancer incidence and mortality, giving rise to the term 'obesity 
paradox'. Potential explanations for this paradox are BMI being a poor measure 
of obesity, confounding by smoking and reverse causation. A literature search of 
this topic yields conflicting conclusions from various authors. We aim to 
clarify the relationship between various measures of obesity, lung cancer risk, 
and lung cancer prognosis.
METHODS: The PubMed database was searched on 10 August 2022 to identify 
published research studies. Literature published in English between 2018 and 
2022 were included. Sixty-nine publications were considered relevant, and their 
full text studied to collate information for this review.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Lower lung cancer incidence and better prognosis was 
associated with increased BMI even after accounting for smoking and pre-clinical 
weight loss. Individuals with high BMI also responded better to treatment 
modalities such as immunotherapy compared to individuals with a normal BMI. 
However, these associations varied highly depending on age, gender, and race. 
Inability of BMI to measure body habitus is the main driver behind this 
variability. The use of anthropometric indicators and image-based techniques to 
quantify central obesity easily and accurately is on the rise. Increase in 
central adiposity is associated with increased incidence and poorer prognosis of 
lung cancer, contrasting BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: The obesity paradox may arise due to the improper use of BMI as a 
measure of body composition. Measures of central obesity better portray the 
deleterious effects of obesity and are more appropriate to be discussed when 
talking about lung cancer. The use of obesity metrics based on anthropometric 
measurements and imaging modalities has been shown to be feasible and practical. 
However, a lack of standardization makes it difficult to interpret the results 
of studies using these metrics. Further research must be done to understand the 
association between these obesity metrics and lung cancer.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-22-1835

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest incidence and 
mortality rate in the world today, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is its 
most common type. However, there is still a paucity of specific tumor markers 
for lung cancer screening. Herein, we detected and compared the levels of 
miR-128-3p and miR-33a-5p in serum exosomes of NSCLC patients and healthy 
volunteers, with the aim of identifying suitable exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) as 
tumor biomarkers, and explored their value in the auxiliary diagnosis of NSCLC.
METHODS: All participants were recruited from September 1, 2022 to December 30, 
2022, and met the inclusion criteria. The case group included 20 patients with 
lung nodules who were highly suspected of having lung cancer (two cases were 
excluded). A total of 18 healthy volunteers (control group) were also enrolled. 
Blood samples were collected in both the case group before surgery and in the 
control group. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used 
to detect the expression of miR-128-3p and miR-33a-5p in serum exosomes. The 
main indicators of statistical analysis included the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.
RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, the NSCLC case group had 
significantly lower expression levels of serum exosome miR-128-3p and miR-33a-5p 
(P<0.01, P<0.001), and there was a significant positive correlation between the 
two exosome miRNAs (r=0.848, P<0.01). The AUC values of miR-128-3p alone and 
miR-33a-5p alone in distinguishing case group and control group were 0.789 [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.637-0.940; sensitivity: 61.1%; specificity: 94.4%; 
P=0.003] and 0.821 (95% CI: 0.668-0.974; sensitivity: 77.8%; specificity: 83.3%; 
and P=0.001), respectively. The combination of miR-128-3p and miR-33a-5p had an 
AUC of 0.855 (95% CI: 0.719-0.991; P<0.001) for distinguishing case group and 
control group, which was greater than the AUC values of miR-128-3p alone and 
miR-33a-5p alone (cut-off value: 0.034; sensitivity: 83.3%; and specificity: 
88.9%). However, there was no significant difference in the AUC among these 
three groups (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum exosome miR-128-3p and miR-33a-5p showed good performance in 
NSCLC screening and may be used as new biomarkers for large-scale NSCLC 
screening.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-23-398

pathogenesis of lung cancer with bone metastasis (LCBM) by bioinformatics 
analysis to provide new targets for treating LCBM and an indicator for early 
monitoring.
METHODS: We first obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 
ferroptosis from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. MiRWalk 2.0 was 
used to predict the key microRNAs (miRNAs) and construct related gene-miRNA 
interaction networks. The functional enrichment analysis of key miRNAs was 
performed using the miEAA database. Finally, the clinical data of 105 lung 
cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed, and logistic regression analysis 
was conducted to assess the relationship between serum alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and bone metastasis in lung cancer 
patients, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn.
RESULTS: We identified 15 ferroptosis-related genes that were differentially 
expressed in lung cancer bone metastasis. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses 
suggested that these genes may affect the oxidative stress response, hypoxia 
response, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial outer membrane, iron-sulfur 
cluster binding, virus receptor activity, central carbon metabolism in cancer, 
the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway, and other aspects to participate 
in the occurrence and development of lung cancer bone metastasis. Among the 105 
lung cancer patients included in the study, 39 cases had bone metastasis, and 
the incidence rate was 37.14%. A high Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
score and serum ALP and NSE overexpression were associated with bone metastasis 
in patients with lung cancer. By assessing the risk of bone metastasis in 
patients with lung cancer, we found that the Area Under Curves (AUCs) of serum 
ALP and NSE alone and combined were >0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: The differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes and 
predicted miRNA regulatory network in lung cancer bone metastasis and the 
related functional enrichment analysis provide new targets for the treatment of 
lung cancer bone metastasis. At the same time, from a serological perspective, 
it was found that early monitoring of serum ALP and NSE expression in patients 
with lung cancer could be considered to assess the risk of bone metastasis in 
the future.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-23-539

non-surgical treatment modalities in the era of contemporary staging and 
treatments, the management of elderly patients with early-stage small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) continues to be debated. This study sought to compare surgery and 
radiotherapy in elderly patients (aged ≥70 years) with early-stage SCLC using 
data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.
METHODS: The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method was used 
to address the selection bias between the surgery and radiotherapy groups. The 
Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were 
used to compare the overall survival (OS) of the treatment cohorts before and 
after the IPTW adjustment. The competing risk survival analyses used Fine and 
Gray's method to compare the cancer-specific survival between the groups.
RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2018, 685 elderly patients received local treatment 
for early-stage SCLC. Of these patients, 193 patients (26.6%) received surgery 
and 492 patients (73.4%) received radiotherapy. Surgery was associated with a 
longer OS time than radiotherapy (median OS time: 32 vs. 20 months; 5-year OS 
time: 30.6% vs. 17.6%; P=0.002). The survival advantage of surgery was 
consistent in the IPTW-adjusted cohort (median OS time: 32 vs. 20 months; 5-year 
OS time: 30.6% vs. 17.6%; P<0.002). In the multivariate analysis, an increased 
age (P=0.001), stage T2 (P=0.047), radiotherapy (P<0.001), and no chemotherapy 
(P=0.034) were associated with unfavorable OS. In the IPTW-adjusted cohort, the 
multivariate analysis showed a decreased age (P<0.001), stage T1 (P=0.038), and 
surgery (P<0.001) were associated with superior OS. The competing risk analyses 
demonstrated that surgery produced a consistent decrease in the cancer-specific 
mortality rate compared to radiotherapy among the patients aged 70-80 years 
(53.6% vs. 61.0%, P=0.01), but no difference was observed in the 5-year 
cumulative incidence rate of cancer-related death between the surgery and 
radiotherapy groups (66.3% vs. 64.9%; P=0.66) in patients aged ≥80 years.

induced damage, leading to radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD). Studies have 
proven that delineation of the heart based on planning CT fails to show the real 
margin of the substructures and a compensatory margin should be applied. The 
purpose of this study was to quantify the dynamic changes and the compensatory 
extension range by breath-hold and electrocardiogram gated 4-dimensional 
magnetic resonance imaging (4D-MRI), which had the advantage of discriminating 
soft tissues.
METHODS: Eventually, 15 patients with oesophageal or lung cancers were enrolled, 
including one female and nine males aged from 59 to 77 years from December 10th, 
2018, to March 4th, 2020. The displacement of the heart and its substructures 
was measured through a fusion volume and the compensatory expansion range was 
calculated by expending the boundary on the planning CT to that of the fusion 
volume. The differences were tested through the Kruskal-Wallis H test and were 
considered significant at a two-side P<0.05.
RESULTS: The extent of movement of heart and its substructures during one 
cardiac cycle were approximately 4.0-26.1 millimetre (mm) in anterior-posterior 
(AP), left-right (LR), and cranial-caudal (CC) axes, and the compensatory 
margins should be applied to planning CT by extending the margins by 1.7, 3.6, 
1.8, 3.0, 2.1, and 2.9 centimetres (cm) for pericardium; 1.2, 2.5, 1.0, 2.8, 
1.8, and 3.3 cm for heart; 3.8, 3.4, 3.1, 2.8, 0.9, and 2.0 cm for interatrial 
septum; 3.3, 4.9, 2.0, 4.1, 1.1, and 2.9 cm for interventricular septum; 2.2, 
3.0, 1.1, 5.3, 1.8, and 2.4 cm for left ventricular muscle (LVM); 5.9, 3.4, 2.1, 
6.1, 5.4, and 3.6 cm for antero-lateral papillary muscle (ALPM); and 6.6, 2.9, 
2.6, 6.6, 3.9, and 4.8 cm for postero-medial papillary muscle (PMPM) in 
anterior, posterior, left, right, cranial, and caudal directions, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Periodic cardiac activity causes obvious displacement of the heart 
and its substructures, and the motion amplitude of substructures differs.

pleural catheter (IPC) with a low complication rate. There is no literature on 
the utility or safety of this treatment modality for NMPE post lung resection. 
We aimed to assess the utility of IPC for recurrent symptomatic NMPE secondary 
to post lung resection in lung cancer patients over a period of 4 years.
METHODS: Patients who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy as part of the 
treatment plan for lung cancer between January 2019 and June 2022 were 
identified, these patients were screened for post-surgical pleural effusion. A 
total of 422 underwent lung resection, of which 12 had recurrent symptomatic 
pleural effusions requiring IPC placement and were selected for final analysis. 
The primary end points were improved symptomatology and successful pleurodesis.
RESULTS: Mean time to IPC placement was 78.4 days post-surgery. The mean length 
of IPC catheter was 77.7 days standard deviation (SD) 23.8. All 12 patients 
achieved spontaneous pleurodesis (SP), there was no second pleural intervention

Hospital, Xiamen, China.","BACKGROUND: The high expression of programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a 
valid biological indicator of the therapeutic benefit of pembrolizumab in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the response rate of NSCLC 
patients with positive PD-L1 expression to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is still low.
METHODS: From January 2019 to January 2021, a retrospective study was conducted 
at the Fujian Medical University Xiamen Humanity Hospital. In total, 143 
patients with advanced NSCLC were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 
the efficacy of the treatment [complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), 
stable disease (SD), or progression disease (PD)] was evaluated. Patients with a 
CR and PR were defined as an objective response (OR) group (n=67), and the other 
patients were defined as a control group (n=76). The differences in the 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and clinical features between the 2 groups were 
compared, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to 
analyze the value of ctDNA in predicting the failure to achieve an OR after 
immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC, and a multivariate regression analysis was 
conducted to analyze the factors affecting the OR after immunotherapy in NSCLC 
patients. R4.0.3 statistical software (Ross Ihaka Robert Gentleman, New Zealand) 
was used to establish and verify the prediction model of OR after immunotherapy 
in NSCLC patients.
RESULTS: CtDNA was valuable in predicting the non-OR of patients with NSCLC 
after immunotherapy, and the area under the curve was 0.750 [95% CI: 
0.673-0.828, P<0.001]. CtDNA <3.72 ng/µL can be used to predict which NSCLC 
patients will achieve objective remission after immunotherapy (P<0.001). Based 
on the regression model, a prediction model was established. The data set was 
randomly divided into the training set and validation set. The sample size of 
the training set was 72 and that of the validation set was 71. The area under 
the ROC curve of the training set was 0.850 (95% CI: 0.760-0.940), and that of 
the validation set was 0.732 (95% CI: 0.616-0.847).

studied independently, but little information has emerged on the interactions 
between radiation therapy (RT) and immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). We 
examine whether RT and ICI are synergistic in causing pneumonitis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort was assembled using the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, including Medicare 
beneficiaries diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th ed. (AJCC) 
stages IIIB-IV NSCLC between 2013-2017. Exposures to RT and ICI were determined 
by evaluating for treatment within 12 months of diagnosis (RT group and ICI 
group) and for a second exposure (e.g., ICI after RT) within 3 months after the 
first exposure (RT + ICI group). Untreated controls were matched to treated 
patients who were diagnosed in the same three-month window. A validated 
algorithm for identifying cases of pneumonitis in claims data was used to 
evaluate for the outcome within 6 months after treatment. The primary outcome 
was the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), a quantitative measure 
of additive interaction between two treatments.
RESULTS: There were 18,780 patients included in the analysis with 9,345 (49.8%), 
7,533 (40.2%), 1,332 (7.1%), and 550 (2.9%) in the control, RT, ICI, and RT + 
ICI groups, respectively. Relative to controls, the hazards ratios of 
pneumonitis were 11.5 (95% CI: 7.9 to 17.0), 6.2 (95% CI: 3.8 to 10.3), and 10.7 
(95% CI: 6.0 to 19.2) in the RT, ICI, and RT-ICI groups, respectively. The RERIs 
were -6.1 (95% CI: -13.1 to -0.6, P=0.97) and -4.0 (95% CI: -10.7 to 1.5, 
P=0.91) in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, respectively, consistent with 
no evidence of additive interaction (RERI ≤0) between RT and ICI.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of Medicare beneficiaries with advanced NSCLC, RT and 
ICI were, at most, additive rather than synergistic in causing pneumonitis.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Although optimal sequencing of systemic therapy in cancer care is 
critical to achieving maximal clinical benefit, there is a lack of analysis of 
treatment sequencing in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) in 
real-world settings.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 13,340 lung cancer patients within the 
Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) was performed. Systemic therapy data of aNSCLC 
in 2,106 patients was the starting point in our analysis to investigate how 
treatment sequencing has evolved, the impact of sequencing patterns on clinical 
outcomes, and the effectiveness of 2nd line chemotherapy after patients 
progressed on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based therapy as the 1st line of 
therapy (LOT).
RESULTS: There is a significant shift to more ICI-based therapy and multiple 
lines of targeted therapy after 2015. We compared clinical outcomes of two 
patient populations with different treatment sequencing patterns, with the 1st 
group receiving chemotherapy as the 1st LOT followed by ICI-based treatment, and 
the 2nd group treated in the opposite order receiving a 1st line ICI-containing 
regimen followed by a 2nd line chemotherapy. No statistically significant 
difference in overall survival (OS) was observed between the two groups [group 2 
vs. group 1, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) =1.36, P=0.39]. We assessed the 
efficacy of the 2nd line chemotherapy in three patient populations given either 
1st line ICI single agent, 1st line ICI-chemotherapy combination, or 1st line 
chemotherapy alone, there was no statistically significant difference in 
time-to-next treatment (TTNT) and in OS among the three patient groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of real-world data has shown two treatment sequencing 
patterns in aNSCLC, ICI followed by chemotherapy or chemotherapy followed by 
ICI, achieved similar clinical benefit. The chemotherapies routinely used 
following platinum doublet 1st LOT, is effective as the 2nd line option after

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Our research aimed to better understand how phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) is linked to survival outcomes in lung cancer patients.
METHODS: We confirmed PCK2 expression and its association with the outcome of 
lung cancer patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. PCK2 and 
immune cell connections were investigated using data from the Tumor IMmune 
Estimation Resource (TIMER) and TCGA repositories. We used the CancerSEA 
database to examine the links between PCK2 expression and the efficiency of lung 
adenocarcinomas, and a T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE) map 
was constructed to show the expression profile of PCK2 in single cells in TCGA 
lung adenocarcinoma samples. The potential mechanism of action was finally 
investigated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment analysis, Gene 
Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis.
RESULTS: The expression of PCK was lower in lung adenocarcinoma tumor tissues 
than in paracancerous tissues. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma who expressed 
PCK2 at high levels fared better in overall survival (OS), disease-specific 
survival (DSS), and progression free interval (PFI). PCK2 was positively 
correlated with programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1) expression, and its mutation 
rate in lung adenocarcinoma was 0.53%. CancerSEA research revealed that in lung 
adenocarcinoma, PCK2 was negatively correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) and hypoxia. Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis 
revealed PCK2-coexpressed genes influenced the onset and progression of lung 
adenocarcinoma by modulating the activity of DNA-binding transcriptional 
activators, the specificity of RNA polymerase II, the interaction between 
neuroactive ligands and their receptors, and the cAMP signaling pathway. The 
prognosis for lung adenocarcinoma was shown to vary according to whether PCK2 
was involved in the response to oxidative stress-induced senescence, gene 
silencing, cell cycle, and other biological processes.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased expression of PCK2 may be employed as a novel 
prognostic biomarker in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and has been shown to 
increase OS, DSS, and PFI. Improving the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma by 
interference with PCK2 may be possible since it induces senescence through the 
oxidative stress response and blocks the immune escape of tumor cells. These 
results point to a probable target anticancer treatment development in lung 
adenocarcinoma.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-23-542

of thoracoscopic surgery and seriously endangers the life of patients. How to 
prevent and manage intraoperative bleeding is a core concern for every thoracic 
surgeon. The aim of our study was to analyze the related risk factors of 
unexpected intraoperative bleeding during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery 
(VATS) and the strategies for managing bleeding.
METHODS: A total of 1,064 patients who underwent anatomical pulmonary resection 
were analyzed retrospectively. According to the presence or absence of 
intraoperative bleeding, all cases were divided into an intraoperative bleeding 
group (IBG) and a reference group (RG). Clinicopathological characteristics and 
perioperative outcomes were compared in both groups. In addition, the sites, 
reasons, and coping strategies of intraoperative bleeding were summarized and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: After rigorous screening, 67 patients with intraoperative bleeding and 
997 patients without intraoperative bleeding were included in our study. 
Compared with the RG, among patients in the IBG, there was a higher incidence of 
history of chest surgery (P<0.001), higher incidence of pleural adhesion 
(P=0.015), higher incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (P=0.034), and the fewer 
early T-stage cases (P=0.003). In the multivariate analyses, a history of chest 
surgery (P=0.001) and T stage (P=0.010) were independent risk factors of 
intraoperative bleeding. The IBG was associated with the longer operative time, 
the more blood loss, the higher rates of intraoperative blood transfusion and 
conversion, the longer hospital stay and the more complications. There were no 
significant differences in the duration of chest drainage (P=0.066) between IBG 
and RG. The most common injury site of intraoperative bleeding was the pulmonary 
artery (72%). The commonest cause of intraoperative bleeding was the accidental 
injury of energy device (37%). The most frequently used method for managing 
intraoperative bleeding was suturing of the bleeding site (64%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although unexpected intraoperative bleeding during VATS is 
unavoidable, it can be controlled provided that positive and effective 
hemostasis are achieved. However, prevention is the priority.",2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-23-305

crizotinib and second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are compared with direct therapy of second-generation 
ALK TKI in ALK-positive advanced lung cancer.
METHODS: Between May 2014 and October 2022, 211 patients from the Zhejiang 
Cancer Hospital who harbored ALK rearrangement were analyzed. Of these patients, 
115 received crizotinib with sequential second-generation ALK TKIs, and 96 
patients received a second-generation ALK TKI directly. The survival analysis of 
median progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and central 
nervous system time to progression (CNS TTP) in the various groups were 
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Of the 211 lung cancer patients with ALK rearrangement, there were no 
statistical differences in PFS (25.27 vs. 20.47 months, P=0.644) and OS (70.27 
months vs. not reached, P=0.991) between the 115 patients in the sequential 
therapy group and the 96 patients in the direct second-generation group. In the 
patients with baseline brain metastases at study entry (n=54), the sequential

and the use of combustible cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems 
(ENDS), and concurrent dual use is a priority for public health. Many published 
reports have not accounted for known covarying factors. This study sought to 
calculate adjusted odds ratios for self-reported COVID infection and disease 
severity as a function of smoking and ENDS use, while accounting for factors 
known to influence COVID infection and disease severity (i.e., age, sex, race 
and ethnicity, socioeconomic status and educational attainment, rural or urban 
environment, self-reported diabetes, COPD, coronary heart disease, and obesity 
status). Data from the 2021 U.S. National Health Interview Survey, a 
cross-sectional questionnaire design, were used to calculate both unadjusted and 
adjusted odds ratios for self-reported COVID infection and severity of symptoms. 
Results indicate that combustible cigarette use is associated with a lower 
likelihood of self-reported COVID infection relative to non-use of tobacco 
products (AOR = .64; 95% CI [.55, .74]), whereas ENDS use is associated with a 
higher likelihood of self-reported COVID infection (AOR = 1.30; 95% CI [1.04, 
1.63]). There was no significant difference in COVID infection among dual users 
(ENDS and combustible use) when compared with non-users. Adjusting for covarying 
factors did not substantially change the results. There were no significant 
differences in COVID disease severity between those of varying smoking status. 
Future research should examine the relationship between smoking status and COVID 
infection and disease severity utilizing longitudinal study designs and 
non-self-report measures of smoking status (e.g., the biomarker cotinine), COVID 
infection (e.g., positive tests), and disease severity (e.g., hospitalizations,

(MWA) are well-established treatments for patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of RFA and MWA 
performed on NSCLC patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included one hundred twenty-four 
patients with NSCLC who underwent percutaneous ablation from November 2014 to 
November 2020 in the Department of Medical Imaging and Interventional Radiology 
of Sotiria General Hospital for Chest Diseases in Athens, Greece. Forty (stage 
IA) were treated with RFA, while 84 were treated with MWA (stages IA, IB, and 
IIA). All procedures were performed using the AMICA GEN radiofrequency and 
microwave generator. As a follow-up method, computed tomography was performed 
immediately after the procedure to evaluate the lesion's response and 
complications and one, three, six, and twelve months after the ablation.
RESULTS: All ablations were technically successful. The first-month follow-up 
revealed stage IIA residual tumors in eight patients. Local recurrence was 
detected one year after RFA in two of the 40 patients and thirteen of the 84 
patients after MWA. Overall survival (OS) rates at one, two, and three years for 
stage IA NSCLC patients treated with ablation were 94 %, 73 %, 57 % for RFA, and 
96 %, 75 %, and 62 % for MWA, respectively. In contrast, the OS for stages IB 
and IIA patients treated with MWA was 90 %, 66 %, and 51 % for the IB stage and 
82 %, 62 %, and 48 % for the IIA stage, respectively. Fifteen percent of 
patients after RFA and 9.5 % after MWA experienced minor complications. 
Pneumothorax was documented in three patients after RFA and four after MWA. 
Post-ablation syndrome occurred in 15 % of RFA patients and 8.3 % of MWA 
patients. There were no major complications.
CONCLUSION: RFA and MWA have comparable efficacy and safety for patients in 
stage IA. MWA is an effective alternative treatment option for non-resectable IB

and eukaryotic systems suggest a similar revolving mechanism in the use of ATP 
to drive translocation of the lengthy double-stranded (ds)DNA genomes. This 
mechanism is exemplified by the dsDNA packaging motor of bacteriophage phi29 
that operates through revolving but not rotating dsDNA to ""Push through a 
one-way valve"". This unique and novel revolving mechanism discovered in phi29 
DNA packaging motor was recently reported in other systems including the dsDNA 
packaging motor of herpesvirus, the dsDNA ejecting motor of bacteriophage T7, 
the plasmid conjugation machine TraB in Streptomyces, the dsDNA translocase FtsK 
of gram-negative bacteria, and the genome-packaging motor in mimivirus. These 
motors exhibit an asymmetrical hexameric structure for transporting the genome 
via an inch-worm sequential action. This review intends to delineate the 
revolving mechanism from a perspective of conformational changes and 
electrostatic interactions. In phi29, the positively charged residues 
Arg-Lys-Arg in the N-terminus of the connector bind the negatively charged 
interlocking domain of pRNA. ATP binding to an ATPase subunit induces the closed 
conformation of the ATPase. The ATPase associates with an adjacent subunit to 
form a dimer facilitated by the positively charged arginine finger. The 
ATP-binding induces a positive charging on its DNA binding surface via an 
allostery mechanism and thus the higher affinity for the negatively charged 
dsDNA. ATP hydrolysis induces an expanded conformation of the ATPase with a 
lower affinity for dsDNA due to the change of the surface charge, but the 
(ADP+Pi)-bound subunit in the dimer undergoes a conformational change that 
repels dsDNA. The positively charged lysine rings of the connector attract dsDNA 
stepwise and periodically to keep its revolving motion along the channel wall, 
thus maintaining the one-way translocation of dsDNA without reversal and sliding 
out. The finding of the presence of the asymmetrical hexameric architectures of 
many ATPases that use the revolving mechanism may provide insights into the 
understanding of translocation of the gigantic genomes including chromosomes in 
complicated systems without coiling and tangling to speed up dsDNA translocation 
and save energy.","© 2023 The Authors. Exploration published by Henan University and John Wiley &

clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) segmentation for rectal 
cancer preoperative radiotherapy.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) scans from 265 rectal cancer 
patients treated at our institution were collected to train and validate 
automatic contouring models. The regions of CTV and OARs were delineated by 
experienced radiologists as the ground truth. We improved the conventional U-Net 
and proposed Flex U-Net, which used a register model to correct the noise caused 
by manual annotation, thus refining the performance of the automatic 
segmentation model. Then, we compared its performance with that of U-Net and 
V-Net. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and 
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) were calculated for quantitative 
evaluation purposes. With a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we found that the 
differences between our method and the baseline were statistically significant 
(P< 0.05).
RESULTS: Our proposed framework achieved DSC values of 0.817 ± 0.071, 0.930 ± 
0.076, 0.927 ± 0.03, and 0.925 ± 0.03 for CTV, the bladder, Femur head-L and 
Femur head-R, respectively. Conversely, the baseline results were 0.803 ± 0.082, 
0.917 ± 0.105, 0.923 ± 0.03 and 0.917 ± 0.03, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our proposed Flex U-Net can enable satisfactory CTV 
and OAR segmentation for rectal cancer and yield superior performance compared 
to conventional methods. This method provides an automatic, fast and consistent 
solution for CTV and OAR segmentation and exhibits potential to be widely 
applied for radiation therapy planning for a variety of cancers.","Copyright © 2023 Sha, Wang, Sha, Xie, Zhou, Zhang and Yin.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1172424

treatment option after chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
(LAPC) is evolving. However adequate patient selection criteria for SABR in 
patients with LAPC are lacking.
METHODS: A prospective institutional database collected data of patients with 
LAPC treated with chemotherapy, mainly FOLFIRINOX, followed by SABR, which was 
delivered using magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy, 40 Gy in 5 fractions 
within two weeks. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Cox regression 
analyses were performed to identify predictors for OS.
RESULTS: Overall, 74 patients were included, median age 66 years, 45.9% had a 
KPS score of ≥90. Median OS was 19.6 months from diagnosis and 12.1 months from 
start of SABR. Local control was 90% at one year. Multivariable Cox regression 
analyses identified KPS ≥90, age <70, and absence of pain prior to SABR as 
independent favorable predictors for OS. The rate of grade ≥3 fatigue and late 
gastro-intestinal toxicity was 2.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: SABR is a well-tolerated treatment in patients with unresectable 
LAPC following chemotherapy, with better outcomes when applied in patients with 
higher performance score, age <70 years and absence of pain. Future randomized 
trials will have to confirm these findings.","Copyright © 2023 Doppenberg, Lagerwaard, van Dieren, Meijerink, van der Vliet,

survival rate of only 23%, the underlying molecular mechanisms of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. There is a great need to identify reliable 
candidate biomarker genes for early diagnosis and targeted therapeutic 
strategies to prevent cancer progression.
METHODS: In this study, four datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
were evaluated for NSCLC- associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using 
bioinformatics analysis. About 10 common significant DEGs were shortlisted based 
on their p-value and FDR (DOCK4, ID2, SASH1, NPR1, GJA4, TBX2, CD24, HBEGF, 
GATA3, and DDR1). The expression of significant genes was validated using 
experimental data obtained from TCGA and the Human Protein Atlas database. The 
human proteomic data for post- translational modifications was used to interpret 
the mutations in these genes.
RESULTS: Validation of DEGs revealed a significant difference in the expression 
of hub genes in normal and tumor tissues. Mutation analysis revealed 22.69%, 
48.95%, and 47.21% sequence predicted disordered regions of DOCK4, GJA4, and 
HBEGF, respectively. The gene-gene and drug-gene network analysis revealed 
important interactions between genes and chemicals suggesting they could act as 
probable drug targets. The system-level network showed important interactions 
between these genes, and the drug interaction network showed that these genes 
are affected by several types of chemicals that could serve as potential drug 
targets.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the importance of systemic genetics in 
identifying potential drug- targeted therapies for NSCLC. The integrative 
system- level approach should contribute to a better understanding of disease 
etiology and may accelerate drug discovery for many cancer types.","Copyright © 2023 Altaf, Ilyas, Ma and Shi.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1206768

colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, but whether adopting a healthy 
lifestyle could attenuate the risk of CRC conferred by metabolic syndrome 
remains unclear. The aim of the study is to investigate the individual and joint 
effects of modifiable healthy lifestyle and metabolic health status on CRC 
incidence and mortality in the UK population.
METHODS: This prospective study included 328,236 individuals from the UK 
Biobank. An overall metabolic health status was assessed at baseline and 
categorized based on the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. We estimated 
the association of the healthy lifestyle score (derived from 4 modifiable 
behaviors: smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity and categorized 
into ""favorable,"" ""intermediate"", and ""unfavorable"") with CRC incidence and 
mortality, stratified by metabolic health status.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.5 years, 3,852 CRC incidences and 1,076 
deaths from CRC were newly identified. The risk of incident CRC and its 
mortality increased with the number of abnormal metabolic factors and decreased 
with healthy lifestyle score (P trend = 0.000). MetS was associated with greater 
CRC incidence (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.16 - 1.33) and mortality (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 
1.08 - 1.41) when compared with those without MetS. An unfavorable lifestyle was 
associated with an increased risk (HR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.36) and mortality 
(HR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.16 - 1.59) of CRC across all metabolic health status. 
Participants adopting an unfavorable lifestyle with MetS had a higher risk (HR = 
1.56, 95% CI: 1.38 - 1.76) and mortality (HR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.40 - 2.20) than 
those adopting a favorable healthy lifestyle without MetS.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that adherence to a healthy lifestyle could 
substantially reduce the burden of CRC regardless of the metabolic status. 
Behavioral lifestyle changes should be encouraged for CRC prevention even in 
participants with MetS.","Copyright © 2023 Xie, Wu, Kuo, Tian, He, Li, Mi, Hu, Zhao, Li, Xia, Yuan, Yang,

for studies on real-world drug utilization. However, there is currently a lack 
of evidence on the accuracy of administrative data in describing the use of 
infusive antineoplastics. In this study, we used rituximab as a case study to 
investigate the validity of the regional administrative healthcare database of 
Tuscany (RAD) in describing the utilization of infusive antineoplastics.
METHODS: We identified patients aged 18 years or older who had received ≥1 
rituximab administration between 2011 and 2014 in the onco-haematology ward of 
the University Hospital of Siena. We retrieved this information from the 
Hospital Pharmacy Database (HPD-UHS) and linked the person-level information to 
RAD. Patients who had received ≥1dispensing of rituximab, single administration 
episodes, and patients treated for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (nHL) or Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) were identified in RAD and validated using HPD-UHS as 
the reference standard. We identified the indications of use using algorithms 
based on diagnostic codes (ICD9CM codes, nHL=200*, 202*; CLL=204.1). We tested 
22 algorithms of different complexity for each indication of use and calculated 
sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV), with 95% confidence intervals 
(95%CI), as measures of validity.
RESULTS: According to HPD-UHS, 307 patients received rituximab for nHL (N=174), 
CLL (N=21), or other unspecified indications (N=112) in the onco-haematology 
ward of the University Hospital of Siena. We identified 295 rituximab users in 
RAD (sensitivity=96.1%), but PPV could not be assessed due to missing 
information in RAD on dispensing hospital wards. We identified individual 
rituximab administration episodes with sensitivity=78.6% [95%CI: 76.4-80.6] and 
PPV=87.6% [95%CI: 86.1-89.2]. Sensitivity of algorithms tested for identifying 
nHL and CLL ranged from 87.7% to 91.9% for nHL and from 52.4% to 82.7% for CLL. 
PPV ranged from 64.7% to 66.1% for nHL and from 32.4% to 37.5% for CLL.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that RAD is a very sensitive source of 
information for identifying patients who received rituximab for 
onco-haematological indications. Single administration episodes were identified 
with good-to-high accuracy. Patients receiving rituximab for nHL were identified 
with high sensitivity and acceptable PPV, while the validity for CLL was 
suboptimal.","Copyright © 2023 Bartolini, Roberto, Girardi, Moscatelli, Spini, Barchielli,

Interleukin 22 binding protein (IL-22BP), a natural antagonist of the cytokine 
interleukin 22 (IL-22) has been shown to control the progression of colorectal 
cancer (CRC). However, the role of IL-22BP in the process of metastasis 
formation remains unknown.
METHODS: We used two different murine in vivo metastasis models using the MC38 
and LLC cancer cell lines and studied lung and liver metastasis formation after 
intracaecal or intrasplenic injection of cancer cells. Furthermore, IL22BP 
expression was measured in a clinical cohort of CRC patients and correlated with 
metastatic tumor stages.
RESULTS: Our data indicate that low levels of IL-22BP are associated with 
advanced (metastatic) tumor stages in colorectal cancer. Using two different 
murine in vivo models we show that IL-22BP indeed controls the progression of 
liver but not lung metastasis in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We here demonstrate a crucial role of IL-22BP in controlling 
metastasis progression. Thus, IL-22 might represent a future therapeutic target 
against the progression of metastatic CRC.","Copyright © 2023 Giannou, Kempski, Zhang, Lücke, Shiri, Zazara, Belios,

are recommended to predict overall survival (OS) or risk of serious adverse 
events (SAEs) in older cancer patients. However, the clinical utility is 
relatively unknown in older patients suffering malnutrition with 
gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, including gastric cancer (GC) and pancreatic 
cancer (PC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included patients aged ≥65 years with 
GC, PC, and colorectal cancer (CRC) who received a G8 questionnaire at first 
visit from April 2018 to March 2020. The associations between G8/IADL and safety 
or OS were assessed in patients with advanced/unresectable tumors.
RESULTS: Of 207 patients (median age: 75 years), the median G8 score was 10.5 
and normal G8 score rate was 6.8%. Both the median G8 score and normal G8 (>14) 
score rate numerically increased in the order of GC < PC < CRC. There was no 
clear association between the G8 standard cutoff value of 14 and SAEs or OS. 
However, OS was significantly longer in patients with G8 >11 than in those with 
G8 ≤11 (19.3 vs. 10.5 months, p = 0.0017). Furthermore, OS was significantly 
better in patients with normal IADL than in those with abnormal IADL (17.6 vs. 
11.4 months, p = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: The G8 cutoff value of 14 would not be clinically useful in patients 
with GI cancer for predicting OS or SAEs; however, the cutoff value of 11 and 
IADL may be useful to predict OS for older patients with GI cancers including GC 
and PC.","Copyright © 2023 Doi, Mizukami, Takeda, Umemoto, Arai, Horie, Izawa, Ogura and

checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are determined by multiple factors. Existed 
biomarkers for predicting the effect of immunotherapy cannot accurately predict 
the response of BLCA patients to ICIs.
METHODS: To further accurately stratify patients' response to ICIs and identify 
potential novel predictive biomarkers, we used the known T cell exhaustion 
(TEX)-related specific pathways, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 
interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-g, and T- cell cytotoxicpathways, combined 
with weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze the 
characteristics of TEX in BLCA in detail, constructed a TEX model.
RESULTS: This model including 28 genes can robustly predict the survival of BLCA 
and immunotherapeutic efficacy. This model could divide BLCA into two groups, 
TEXhigh and TEXlow, with significantly different prognoses, clinical features, 
and reactivity to ICIs. The critical characteristic genes, such as potential 
biomarkers Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 4C (CHMP4C), SH2 Domain 
Containing 2A (SH2D2A), Prickle Planar Cell Polarity Protein 3 (PRICKLE3) and 
Zinc Finger Protein 165 (ZNF165) were verified in BLCA clinical samples by 
real-time quantitative chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
DISCUSSION: Our findings show that the TEX model can serve as biological markers 
for predicting the response to ICIs, and the involving molecules in the TEX 
model might provide new potential targets for immunotherapy in BLCA.","Copyright © 2023 Xue, Zhao, Pu and Jiao.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1196802

cancer, but its therapeutic effect on hepatocellular carcinoma is still unclear.
METHODS: Over 800 drugs were screened by CCK8 technology and afatinib was found 
to have a significant inhibitory effect on liver cancer cells. The expression of 
PDL1 in tumor cells treated with drugs were detected by qRT-PCR and Weston Blot 
experiments. The effects of afatinib on the growth, migration and invasion of 
HCC cells were evaluated using wound healing, Transwell, and cell cloning 
assays. The in vivo effects of afatinib in combination with anti-PD1 were 
evaluated in C57/BL6J mice with subcutaneous tumorigenesis. Bioinformatics 
analysis was performed to explore the specific mechanism of afatinib's 
inhibition of ERBB2 in improving the expression level of PD-L1, which was 
subsequently verified through experiments.
RESULTS: Afatinib was found to have a significant inhibitory effect on liver 
cancer cells, as confirmed by in vitro experiments, which demonstrated that it 
could significantly suppress the growth, invasion and migration of HCC cells. 
qRT PCR and Weston Blot experiments also showed that Afatinib can enhance the 
expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells. In addition, in vitro experiments confirmed 
that afatinib can significantly enhance the immunotherapeutic effect of 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Afatinib's ability to increase PD-L1 expression is 
mediated by STAT3 activation following its action on HCC cells.
CONCLUSION: Afatinib enhances PD-L1 expression in tumor cells through the 
STAT3/PD-L1 pathway. The combination of afatinib and anti-PD1 treatment 
significantly increases the immunotherapeutic effect of HCC.","Copyright © 2023 Yu, Zhang, Wang, Xu, Zhao, Feng, Pan, Yang, Zhou, Shang and Ma.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1198118

epithelium and accounts for about 3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. 
Unfortunately, the majority of patients are not eligible for surgical resection 
at the time of diagnosis, because of the locally advanced stage or metastatic 
disease. The overall survival time of unresectable CCA is generally less than 1 
year, despite current chemotherapy regimens. Biliary drainage is often required 
as a palliative treatment for patients with unresectable CCA. Recurrent jaundice 
and cholangitis tend to occur because of reobstruction of the biliary stents. 
This not only jeopardizes the efficacy of chemotherapy, but also causes 
significant morbidity and mortality. Effective control of tumor growth is 
crucial for prolonging stent patency and consequently patient survival. 
Recently, endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (ERFA) has been experimented as a 
treatment modality to reduce tumor mass, and delay tumor growth, extending stent 
patency. Ablation is accomplished by means of high-frequency alternating current 
which is released from the active electrode of an endobiliary probe placed in a 
biliary stricture. It has been shown that tumor necrosis releases intracellular 
particles which are highly immunogenic and activate antigen-presenting cells, 
enhancing local immunity directed against the tumor. This immunogenic response 
could potentially enhance tumor suppression and be responsible for improved 
survival of patients with unresectable CCA who undergo ERFA. Several studies 
have demonstrated that ERFA is associated with an increased median survival of 
approximately 6 months in patients with unresectable CCA. Furthermore, recent 
data support the hypothesis that ERFA could ameliorate the efficacy of 
chemotherapy administered to patients with unresectable CCA, without increasing 
the risk of complications. This narrative review discusses the results of the 
studies published in recent years and focuses on the impact that ERFA could have 
on overall survival of patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.","Copyright © 2023 Di Girolamo, Belli, Ottaiano, Granata, Borzillo, Tarotto,

causes of death globally. Around 20-25% of patients present with metastases at 
the time of diagnosis, and 50-60% of patients develop metastases in due course 
of the disease. Liver, followed by lung and lymph nodes, are the most common 
sites of colorectal cancer metastases. In such patients, the 5-year survival 
rate is approximately 19.2%. Although surgical resection is the primary mode of 
managing colorectal cancer metastases, only 10-25% of patients are competent for 
curative therapy. Hepatic insufficiency may be the aftermath of extensive 
surgical hepatectomy. Hence formal assessment of future liver remnant volume 
(FLR) is imperative prior to surgery to prevent hepatic failure. The evolution 
of minimally invasive interventional radiological techniques has enhanced the 
treatment algorithm of patients with colorectal cancer metastases. Studies have 
demonstrated that these techniques may address the limitations of curative 
resection, such as insufficient FLR, bi-lobar disease, and patients at higher 
risk for surgery. This review focuses on curative and palliative role through 
procedures including portal vein embolization, radioembolization, and ablation. 
Alongside, we deliberate various studies on conventional chemoembolization and 
chemoembolization with irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads. The 
radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres has evolved as salvage therapy in 
surgically unresectable and chemo-resistant metastases.","Copyright © 2023 Vulasala, Sutphin, Kethu, Onteddu and Kalva.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.963966

factor underlying cancer recurrence and metastasis after operative therapy and 
chemoradiotherapy. Understanding the potential mechanism of breast cancer stem 
cells (BCSCs) may ameliorate the prognosis of patients.
METHODS: We collected clinical specimens of BC patients for staining and 
statistical analysis to verify the expression status and clinical significance 
of complement C1q-like 4 (C1ql4). Western blot and qRT-PCR were employed to 
detect the expression of molecules. Flow cytometry was used to examine cell 
cycle, cell apoptosis and the portion of BCSCs. Wound healing and Transwell 
assays were used to detect cell metastasis. The effect of C1ql4 on breast cancer 
progression in vivo was examined in a nude mouse tumor bearing model.
RESULTS: Our clinical analysis showed that C1ql4 was highly expressed in BC 
tissues and cell lines, and the high expression of C1ql4 was significantly 
corelated with the malignancy of BC patients. Moreover, we also found that C1ql4 
was overexpressed in BCSCs. C1ql4 knockdown suppressed the BCSC and EMT 
properties, promoted cell cycle progression, enhanced BC cell apoptosis, and 
inhibited cell migration and invasion, whereas the C1ql4 overexpression 
exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, C1ql4 promoted the activation 
and nuclear location of NF-κB and the expression of downstream factors TNF-α and 
IL-1β. Moreover, inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling suppressed the C1ql4-induced 
stemness and EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that C1ql4 promotes the BC cell stemness and 
EMT via modulating the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling, and provides a promising target 
for BC treatment.","Copyright © 2023 Xu, Wang, Zhen, Duan, Li and Liu.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1192482

(1)Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Medical 
School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.","BACKGROUND: The development of transoral endoscopic vestibular approach 
thyroidectomy (TOETVA) has been limited by inherent defects, such as mental 
nerve injury and carbon dioxide (CO2)-related complications. Herein, we proposed 
a new technique without CO2 called gasless submental-transoral combined approach 
endoscopic thyroidectomy (STET) to solve the problems in TOETVA.
METHODS: We reviewed 75 patients who successfully underwent gasless STET using 
novel instruments at our institution from November 2020 to November 2021. A main 
incision of approximately 2 cm was made in the natural submental crease line and 
then combined with two vestibule incisions to complete the procedure. 
Demographic data, surgical technique and perioperative outcomes were 
retrospectively recorded.
RESULTS: Thirteen male and sixty-two female patients with a mean age of 34.0 ± 
8.1 years were enrolled in this study. Sixty-eight patients had papillary 
thyroid carcinomas and seven had benign nodules. We successfully performed all 
gasless STET without conversion to open surgery. The average postoperative 
hospital stay was 4.2 ± 1.8 days. One transient recurrent laryngeal nerve injury 
and two transient hypoparathyroidisms were observed. Three patients complained 
of slight lower lip numbness on the first postoperative day. One case of 
lymphatic fistula, subcutaneous effusion, and incision swelling occurred each, 
all of which were conservatively cured. One patient developed a recurrence six 
months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Gasless STET using our own designed suspension system is 
technically safe and feasible with reasonable operative and oncologic results.","Copyright © 2023 Jiang, He, Chu, Li, Lu, Jiang, Xie, Gao and Zhang.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1115927

(1)Institute (College) of Integrative Medicine, Dalian Medical University, 
Dalian, China.","OBJECTIVE: As one of the cancers that seriously threatens women's health, 
ovarian cancer has a high morbidity and mortality rate. Surgery and chemotherapy 
are the basic treatment strategies for ovarian cancer, and chemotherapy 
resistance is a significant factor in affecting the prognosis, survival cycle, 
and recurrence of ovarian cancer. This article aims to analyze articles about 
ovarian cancer and drug resistance via bibliometric software, offering new ideas 
and directions for researchers in this field.
METHODS: Both Citespace and Vosviewer are bibliometric software on the Java 
platform. Articles were collected on ovarian cancer and drug resistance in the 
Web of Science Core Collection database from 2013 to 2022. The countries, 
institutions, journals, authors, keywords, and references were analyzed, and the 
development status of this field was indicated from multiple perspectives.
RESULTS: Studies on ovarian cancer and drug resistance generally showed an 
increasing trend from 2013 to 2022. The People's Republic of China and Chinese 
institutions contributed more to this field. Gynecologic Oncology published the 
most articles, and the journal with the most citations was Cancer Research. Li 
Li was the author with the most publications, and Siegel RL was the author with 
the most citations. Through burst detection, it can be found that the research 
hotspots in this field mainly focused on the in-depth exploration of the drug 
resistance mechanism of ovarian cancer and the progress of PARP inhibitors and 
bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Many studies on the mechanism of drug resistance in ovarian cancer 
have been discovered; however, the deeper mechanism remains to be explored. 
Compared with traditional chemotherapy drugs, PARP inhibitors and bevacizumab 
have shown better efficacy, but PARP inhibitors have initially shown drug 
resistance. The future direction of this field should be to overcome the 
resistance of existing drugs and actively develop new ones.","Copyright © 2023 Liu, Ma, Zhang, Li, Yu, Choe, Ding, Zhang and Zhang.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1173863

pose diagnostic challenges. There is a paucity of literature quantifying the 
frequency and extent of therapeutic delays in PSM and its impact on oncological 
outcomes.
METHODS: A review of a prospectively maintained registry of PSM patients 
undergoing Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy 
(CRS-HIPEC) was conducted. Causes for treatment delays were identified. We 
evaluate the impact of delayed presentation and treatment delays on oncological 
outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: 319 patients underwent CRS-HIPEC over a 6-years duration. 58 patients 
were eventually included in this study. Mean duration between symptom onset and 
CRS-HIPEC was 186.0 ± 37.1 days (range 18-1494 days) and mean duration of 
between patient-reported symptom onset and initial presentation was 56.7 ± 16.8 
days. Delayed presentation (> 60 days between symptom onset and presentation) 
was seen in 20.7% (n=12) of patients and 50.0% (n=29) experienced a significant 
treatment delay of > 90 days between 1st presentation and CRS-HIPEC. Common 
causes for treatment delays were healthcare provider-related i.e. delayed or 
inappropriate referrals (43.1%) and delayed presentation to care (31.0%). 
Delayed presentation was a significantly associated with poorer disease free 
survival (DFS) (HR 4.67, 95% CI 1.11-19.69, p=0.036).
CONCLUSION: Delayed presentation and treatment delays are common and may have an 
impact on oncological outcomes. There is an urgent need to improve patient 
education and streamline healthcare delivery processes in the management of PSM.","Copyright © 2023 Tan, Wong, Seo, Lim, Zhu, Ong and Chia.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1137785

metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), colorectal cancer, and 
hepatocarcinoma. Anyway, the toxicity profile of Regorafenib standard schedule 
is associated with poor compliance and a high rate of discontinuation. For this 
reason, there is a growing need for a Regorafenib personalized schedule emerging 
from the scientific community.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this case series was to describe the experience of our 
sarcoma referral center with the continuous administration of Regorafenib as an 
alternative regimen to treat metastatic GIST patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological, and radiological 
data of patients with metastatic GIST treated with daily personalized 
Regorafenib at a single tertiary referral center from May 2021 to December 2022.
RESULTS: We identified three patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The 
average follow-up since the start of Regorafenib was 19.1 months (12-25 months). 
All three patients had started a standard third-line Regorafenib schedule 
according to guidelines. The reasons for switching to a continuous schedule were 
as follows: exacerbation of symptoms during week-off treatment in the first 
patient, a serious adverse event (AE) in the second patient, and a combination 
of both conditions in the third. After switching, none of the patients reported 
severe AEs, and they improved control of tumor-related symptoms. Two of the 
patients experienced disease progression after 16 months (9 months of which is 
continuous schedule) and 12 months (8.1 months of which is continuous schedule) 
of Regorafenib, respectively; the third patient is still receiving continuous 
Regorafenib at the time of writing, with a progression-free survival of 25 
months (14 months after the modified schedule start).
CONCLUSION: With a similar efficacy and lower toxicities, a daily, personalized 
Regorafenib schedule seems to be a promising alternative to the standard regimen 
for metastatic GIST patients, including the frail ones. Further prospective 
analyses are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of such regimen.","Copyright © 2023 Grimaudo, Laffi, Gennaro, Fazio, D’Orazio, Samà, Siracusano,

factors in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer receiving 
first-line chemoimmunotherapy in the real world. This sub-analysis assessed the 
immunotherapy-related adverse effects (irAEs) seen in this cohort, their impact 
on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and related 
clinical factors.
METHODS: The Spinnaker study was a retrospective multicentre observational 
cohort study of patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus 
platinum-based chemotherapy in six United Kingdom and one Swiss oncology 
centres. Data were collected on patient characteristics, survival outcomes, 
frequency and severity of irAEs, and peripheral immune-inflammatory blood 
markers, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic 
immune-inflammation index (SII).
RESULTS: A total of 308 patients were included; 132 (43%) experienced any grade 
irAE, 100 (32%) Grade 1-2, and 49 (16%) Grade 3-4 irAEs. The median OS in 
patients with any grade irAES was significantly longer (17.5 months [95% CI, 
13.4-21.6 months]) than those without (10.1 months [95% CI, 8.3-12.0 months]) 
(p<0.001), either if Grade 1-2 (p=0.003) or Grade 3-4 irAEs (p=0.042). The 
median PFS in patients with any grade irAEs was significantly longer (10.1 
months [95% CI, 9.0-11.2 months]) than those without (6.1 months [95% CI, 
5.2-7.1 months]) (p<0.001), either if Grade 1-2 (p=0.011) or Grade 3-4 irAEs 
(p=0.036). A higher rate of irAEs of any grade and specifically Grade 1-2 irAEs 
correlated with NLR <4 (p=0.013 and p=0.018), SII <1,440 (p=0.029 ad p=0.039), 
response to treatment (p=0.001 and p=0.034), a higher rate of treatment 
discontinuation (p<0.00001 and p=0.041), and the NHS-Lung prognostic classes 
(p=0.002 and p=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm survival outcome benefits in patients with 
irAEs and suggest a higher likelihood of Grade 1-2 irAEs in patients with lower 
NLR or SII values or according to the NHS-Lung score.","Copyright © 2023 Anpalakhan, Huddar, Behrouzi, Signori, Cave, Comins,

upregulation of various cancers, highlighting its crucial role in oncology and 
immunity. In order to better understand the biological function of FJX1 and 
identify new immunotherapy targets for cancer, we conducted a comprehensive 
analysis of this gene.
METHODS: We analyzed the expression profiles and prognostic value of FJX1 using 
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). 
Copy number alterations (CNAs), mutations, and DNA methylation were analyzed 
through cBioPortal. The Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) was used 
to examine the correlation between FJX1 expression and immune cell infiltration. 
The relationship between FJX1 expression and immune-related genes and 
immunosuppressive pathway-related genes was analyzed using The Tumor Immune 
Estimation Resource version 2 (TIMER2). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and 
microsatellite instability (MSI) were obtained from TCGA pan-cancer data. The 
effect of immunotherapy and the IC50 were assessed using IMvigor210CoreBiologies 
and Genomics For Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC). Finally, we evaluated the 
impact of FJX1 on colon cancer cell proliferation and migration through in vitro 
functional experiments.
RESULTS: Our study indicated that FJX1 expression was high in most cancers and 
was significantly associated with poor prognosis. High FJX1 expression was also 
linked to significant alterations in CNA, DNA methylation, TMB, and MSI. 
Positive correlations were found between FJX1 expression and tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) and with immune-related genes such as TGFB1 and IL-10 and 
immunosuppressive pathway-related genes such as TGFB1 and WNT1. On the other 
hand, FJX1 expression showed a negative relationship with CD8+ T cells. 
Furthermore, high FJX1 expression led to reduced effectiveness of immunotherapy 
and drug resistance. In colon cancer cells, FJX1 knockdown was found to decrease 
cell proliferation and migration.
CONCLUSION: Our research findings demonstrate that FJX1 is a new prognostic 
factor with a significant role in tumor immunity. Our results highlight the 
importance of further exploring the potential of targeting FJX1 as a therapeutic 
strategy in cancer.","Copyright © 2023 Huang, Guo, Meng, Zhou, Xiong, Ding, Zhang, Liu and Zhuang.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1170482

nanoparticles (NPs), a type of polymeric NPs, loaded with IR780, a near-infrared 
(NIR) dye, and doxorubicin (DOX) as the chemotherapeutic drug, were assembled by 
an improved double emulsification method (designated as IDNPs). The 
characterization, intracellular uptake, biosafety, photoacoustic (PA) imaging 
performance, and biodistribution of IDNPs were studied. Chemo-photothermal 
therapeutic effect and immunogenic cell death (ICD) were evaluated both in vitro 
and in vivo. The potency of chemo-photothermal therapy-triggered ICD in 
combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy in 
eliciting immune response and treating distant tumors was further investigated.
RESULTS: IR780 and DOX were successfully loaded into PLGA-PEG to form the IDNPs, 
with size of 243.87nm and Zeta potential of -6.25mV. The encapsulation 
efficiency of IR780 and DOX was 83.44% and 5.98%, respectively. IDNPs 
demonstrated remarkable on-site accumulation and PA imaging capability toward 
4T1 TNBC models. Chemo-photothermal therapy demonstrated satisfactory 
therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, and triggered ICD efficiently. 
ICD, in combination with anti-PD-1, provoked a systemic antitumor immune 
response against distant tumors.
CONCLUSION: Multifunctional IDNPs were successfully synthesized to mediate 
chemo-photothermal therapy, which combines immunogenic cell death with 
checkpoint blockade to combat TNBC and distant metastasis, showing great promise 
preclinically and clinically.",© 2023 Zhu et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S408855

β-adrenergic receptors in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Carvedilol is a widely 
used non-selective β-AR antagonist with potential anticancer activity. The 
purpose of the study was to estimate the influence of carvedilol and sorafenib 
alone and in combination on the growth and inflammatory response of C32 and 
A2058 melanoma cells. Furthermore, this study also aimed to predict the probable 
interaction of carvedilol and sorafenib when administered together. Predictive 
study of the interaction of carvedilol and sorafenib was performed using the 
ChemDIS-Mixture system. Carvedilol and sorafenib alone and in combination showed 
a growth inhibitory effect on cells. The greatest synergistic antiproliferative 
effect on both cell lines was observed at Car 5 μM combined with Sor 5 μM. 
Analysis in silico identified diseases, proteins, and metabolic pathways that 
can be affected by the interaction of carvedilol and sorafenib. The results 
obtained demonstrated that carvedilol and sorafenib modulated the secretion of 
IL-8 by IL-1β-stimulated by melanoma cell lines but the use of a combination of 
both drugs did not intensify the effect. In summary, the results presented 
indicate that the combination of carvedilol and sorafenib may have a promising 
anticancer effect on melanoma cells.",© 2023 The Authors.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jsps.2023.05.020

different sample types in women, namely stool brought from home vs. solid stool 
samples obtained at the time of an unprepped sigmoidoscopy vs. biopsies of the 
colonic mucosa at the time of an unprepped sigmoidoscopy, using alpha- and 
beta-diversity metrics following bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing. The findings may 
have relevance to health and disease states in which bacterial metabolism has a 
significant impact on molecules/metabolites that are recirculated between the 
gut lumen and mucosa and systemic circulation, such as estrogens (as in breast 
cancer) or bile acids.
METHODS: Concomitant at-home-collected stool, endoscopically-collected stool, 
and colonic biopsy samples were collected from 48 subjects (24 breast cancer, 24 
control.) After 16S rRNA sequencing, an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) based 
approach was used to analyze the data. Alpha diversity metrics (Chao1, Pielou's 
Evenness, Faith PD, Shannon, and Simpson) and beta diversity metrics 
(Bray-Curtis, Weighted and Unweighted Unifrac) were calculated. LEfSe was used 
to analyze differences in the abundance of various taxa between sample types.
RESULTS: Alpha and beta diversity metrics were significantly different between 
the three sample types. Biopsy samples were different than stool samples in all 
metrics. The highest variation in microbiome diversity was noted in the colonic 
biopsy samples. At-home and endoscopically-collected stool showed more 
similarities in count-based and weighted beta diversity metrics. There were 
significant differences in rare taxa and phylogenetically-diverse taxa between 
the two types of stool samples. Generally, there were higher levels of 
Proteobacteria in biopsy samples, with significantly more Actinobacteria and 
Firmicutes in stool (all p < 0.001, q-value < 0.05). Overall, there was a 
significantly higher relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae 
in stool samples (at-home collected and endoscopically-collected) and higher 
abundances of Tisserellaceae in biopsy samples (all p < 0.001, q-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our data shows that different sampling methods can impact results 
when looking at the composition of the gut microbiome using ASV-based 
approaches.","Copyright © 2023 Nowicki, Ray, Engen, Madrigrano, Witt, Lad, Cobleigh and Mutlu.","DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1148097

(#)Contributed equally","Mangrove rhizosphere soils host diverse Actinobacteria tolerant to numerous 
stresses and are inevitably capable of exhibiting excellent biological activity 
by producing impressive numbers of bioactive natural products, including those 
with potential medicinal applications. In this study, we applied an integrated 
strategy of combining phylogenetic diversity, biological activities, and 
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) screening approach to investigate the 
biotechnological importance of Actinobacteria isolated from mangrove rhizosphere 
soils from Hainan Island. The actinobacterial isolates were identifified using a 
combination of colony morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence 
analysis. Based on the results of PCR-detected BGCs screening, type I and II 
polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal synthetase (NRPS) genes were 
detected. Crude extracts of 87 representative isolates were subjected to 
antimicrobial evaluation by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of 
each strain against six indicator microorganisms, anticancer activities were 
determined on human cancer cell lines HepG2, HeLa, and HCT-116 using an MTT 
colorimetric assay, and immunosuppressive activities against the proliferation 
of Con A-induced T murine splenic lymphocytes in vitro. A total of 287 
actinobacterial isolates affiliated to 10 genera in eight families of six orders 
were isolated from five different mangrove rhizosphere soil samples, 
specififically, Streptomyces (68.29%) and Micromonospora (16.03%), of which 87 
representative strains were selected for phylogenetic analysis. The crude 
extracts of 39 isolates (44.83%) showed antimicrobial activity against at least 
one of the six tested indicator pathogens, especially ethyl acetate extracts of 
A-30 (Streptomyces parvulus), which could inhibit the growth of six microbes 
with MIC values reaching 7.8 μg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and its 
resistant strain, compared to the clinical antibiotic ciproflfloxacin. 
Furthermore, 79 crude extracts (90.80%) and 48 (55.17%) of the isolates 
displayed anticancer and immunosuppressive activities, respectively. Besides, 
four rare strains exhibited potent immunosuppressive activity against the 
proliferation of Con A-induced T murine splenic lymphocyte in vitro with an 
inhibition rate over 60% at 10 μg/mL. Type I and II polyketide synthase (PKS) 
and non-ribosomal synthetase (NRPS) genes were detected in 49.43, 66.67, and 
88.51% of the 87 Actinobacteria, respectively. Signifificantly, these strains 
(26 isolates, 29.89%) harbored PKS I, PKS II, and NRPS genes in their genomes. 
Nevertheless, their bioactivity is independent of BGCs in this study. Our 
findings highlighted the antimicrobial, immunosuppressive, and anticancer 
potential of mangrove rhizosphere Actinobacteria from Hainan Island and the 
biosynthetic prospects of exploiting the corresponding bioactive natural 
product.","Copyright © 2023 Ye, Zou, Zhou, Deng, Wu, Chen and Xu.","DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1157601

distribution among female populations in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, which 
can be conducive for local governments to formulate cervical cancer screening 
and HPV vaccine strategies.
METHODS: Cervical swabs were collected from 47,926 participants aged 16-92 years 
at the Women and Children's Hospital, Xiamen University, from November 2019 to 
June 2020. HPV DNA was extracted and detected using conventional PCR, followed 
by HPV subtype-specific hybridisation. HPV infection rates based on different 
groups were compared using the χ2 test. HPV prevalence and the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using SPSS 19.0.
RESULTS: The overall HPV prevalence among the 47,926 cervical swabs that were 
analysed was 15.13%, of which single, double, and multiple infections accounted 
for 76.83, 16.70 and 6.47%, respectively. The age-specific prevalence of HPV 
infection presented a ""U"" curve with a HPV prevalence peak observed in women 
aged <20 years. The gynaecology clinic group had significantly higher HPV 
positive rates than the health examination group (p < 0.001). The five most 
common HR-HPV subtypes in Xiamen were HPV52, 58, 16, 51, and 39 (2.69, 1.63,

potential to enter cell membranes. Along with nucleic acids, large proteins, and 
other chemical compounds, they can deliver several bioactive cargos inside 
cells. Numerous CPPs have been extracted from natural or synthetic materials 
since the discovery of the first CPP. In the past few decades, a significant 
variety of studies have shown the potential of CPPs to cure different diseases. 
The low toxicity in peptide compared to other drug delivery carriers is a 
significant benefit of CPP-based therapy, in addition to the high efficacy 
brought about by swift and effective delivery. A significant tendency for 
intracellular DNA delivery may also be observed when nanoparticles and the cell 
penetration peptide are combined. CPPs are frequently used to increase 
intracellular absorption of nucleic acid, and other therapeutic agents inside 
the cell. Due to long-term side effects and possible toxicity, its 
implementation is restricted. The use of cell-permeating peptides is a commonly 
used technique to increase their intracellular absorption. Additionally, CPPs 
have lately been sought for application in vivo, following their success in 
cellular studies. This review will go through the numerous CPPs, the chemical

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Profilin-1 (PFN1) regulates the dynamic balance of actin and plays 
an important role in cell functions as a hub protein in signaling molecule 
interaction networks. Dysregulation of PFN1 is related to pathologic kidney 
diseases. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) was recently reported as an inflammatory 
disorder, however, the molecular mechanisms of PFN1 in DN remain unclear. 
Therefore, the present study was conducted to explore the molecular and 
bioinformatic characteristics of PFN1 in DN.
METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses were performed on the chip of database in DN 
kidney tissues. A cellular model of DN was established in human renal tubular 
epithelial cells (HK-2) induced by high glucose. The PFN1 gene was overexpressed 
or knocked-down to investigate its function in DN. Flow cytometry was used to 
detect cell proliferation and apoptosis. PFN1 and proteins in the related 
signaling pathways were evaluated by Western blotting.
RESULTS: The expression of PFN1 was significantly increased in DN kidney tissues 
(P < 0.001) and was correlated with a high apoptosis-associated score (Pearson's 
correlation = 0.664) and cellular senescence-associated score (Pearson's 
correlation = 0.703). PFN1 protein was mainly located in cytoplasm. 
Overexpression of PFN1 promoted apoptosis and blocked the proliferation of HK-2 
cells treated with high levels of glucose. Knockdown of PFN1 led to the opposite 
effects. Additionally, we found that PFN1 was correlated with the inactivation 
of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in HK-2 cells treated with high levels of 
glucose.
CONCLUSION: PFN1 might play an integral role in the regulation of cell 
proliferation and apoptosis during DN development by activating the Hedgehog 
signaling pathway. This study provided molecular and bioinformatic 
characterizations of PFN1, and contributed to the understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms leading to DN.",© 2023 Mai et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/DMSO.S411781

on malignant LUAD behaviors. In addition, the role of forkhead box protein M1 
(FOXM1) in MRPL51 transcription was studied. Bioinformatics analysis and 
subsequent in vitro experiments, including western blotting, immunofluorescent 
staining, Transwell invasion assay, dual-luciferase assay and chromatin 
immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR were conducted. The results demonstrated 
that MRPL51 expression was upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in 
LUAD tissues compared with normal lung tissues. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
demonstrated that LUAD tissues with higher MRPL51 expression also had higher 
expression levels of genes enriched in multiple gene sets, including 
'DNA_REPAIR', 'UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_RESPONSE', 'MYC_TARGETS_V1', 'OXIDATIVE_ 
PHOSPHORYLATION', 'MTORC1_SIGNALING', 'REACTIVE_OXYGEN_SPECIES_PATHWAY', 'MYC_

positively correlated with 'cell cycle', 'DNA damage', 'DNA repair', 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition ('EMT'), 'invasion' and 'proliferation' of 
LUAD cells at the single-cell level. Compared to the negative control, MRPL51 
knockdown decreased N-cadherin and vimentin expression but increased E-cadherin 
expression in A549 and Calu-3 cells. MRPL51 knockdown suppressed cell 
proliferation, induced G1 phase arrest and decreased cell invasion. Patients 
with LUAD and higher MRPL51 expression had a significantly shorter overall 
survival (OS). FOXM1 could bind to the MRPL51 gene promoter and activate its 
transcription. In conclusion, MRPL51 was transcriptionally activated by FOXM1 in 
LUAD and contributed to the malignant behaviors of tumor cells, including EMT, 
cell cycle progression and invasion. High MRPL51 expression may be a prognostic

rare. The present study describes a case of hepatic NEN presenting as a giant 
hepatic cystic lesion. A 42-year-old woman presented with a large liver tumor. 
Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed a cystic tumor (18 cm) 
in their left liver. The tumor exhibited liquid components and mural solid 
nodules with enhanced effects. The lesion was diagnosed as mucinous cystic 
carcinoma (MCC) preoperatively. The patient underwent a left hepatectomy, and 
the postoperative course was uneventful. The patient has been alive without 
recurrence for 36 months postoperatively. The pathological diagnosis was NEN G2. 
This patient had ectopic pancreatic tissue in the liver and thus the ectopic 
pancreatic origin of the tumor was suspected. The present study describes a case 
of resected cystic primary NEN of the liver that was difficult to differentiate 
from mucinous cystic neoplasms. As primary liver NENs are extremely rare, 
further studies are needed to establish their diagnosis and treatment.","Copyright © 2023, Spandidos Publications.","DOI: 10.3892/ol.2023.13890

that account for ~0.15% of all malignancies. The purpose of the present study 
was to determine the differences between RPS and non-RPS anatomopathological and 
clinical features and to analyze whether the hazard ratio for short-term 
mortality differs between patients with RPS and non-RPS, after adjusting for 
differences in baseline anatomopathological and clinical features. The Veneto 
Cancer Registry, a high-resolution population-based dataset spanning the 
regional population, was used as a data source for the analysis. The current 
analysis focuses on all incident cases of soft-tissue sarcoma recorded by the 
Registry from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. A bivariate analysis was 
carried out to compare demographic and clinical characteristics in RPS and 
non-RPS. Short-term mortality risk was analyzed by primary tumor site. The 
significance of variations in survival by site group was determined using 
Kaplan-Meier curves and the Log-rank test. Finally, Cox regression was used to 
assess the hazard ratio for survival by sarcoma group. RPS accounted for 22.8% 
of the total sample (92 out of 404 cases). The mean age at diagnosis was 67.6 
years for RPS vs. 63.4 for non-RPS; 41.3% of RPS were >150 mm vs. 5.5% for 
non-RPS. Stages III and IV were more prevalent in RPS (53.2 vs. 35.6%), despite 
the fact that, in both groups, advanced stages are the most common onset at 
diagnosis. Regarding surgical margins, the present study showed that R0 is the 
most prevalent in non-RPS (48.7%), while R1-R2 is the most frequent in patients 
with RPS (39.1%). The 3-year mortality rate for retroperitoneum was 42.9 vs. 
25.7%. Comparing RPS and non-RPS, the multivariable Cox model showed a hazard 
ratio of 1.58 after adjusting for all other prognostic factors. RPS clinical and 
anatomopathological characteristics differ from those of non-RPS. Overall, 
despite adjusting for other prognostic factors, the retroperitoneum site was an 
independent prognostic factor associated with a worse overall survival in 
sarcoma patients compared with other sites.",Copyright: © Buja et al.,"DOI: 10.3892/ol.2023.13887

Oncology, Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital (Xi'an, China) and included in 
the present study. The expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor 
and HER2 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The subjects were divided into 
two groups: the HER2-negative (0) cohort (n=31) and the HER2 low expression 
cohort (n=41). The age, BMI, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, tumor 
size, lymph node metastasis, pathological type, Ki-67 expression and menopausal 
status of the patients were obtained through the electronic medical record 
system of Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital. Progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) were evaluated for all patients. The median PFS and OS 
of the HER2(0) cohort were longer than those of the HER2 low expression cohort 
(all P<0.05). It was shown that age (hazard ratio, 6.000 and 5.465), KPS score 
(hazard ratio, 4.000 and 3.865), lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio, 3.143;

to be 30%, and radiotherapy (RT) is used for pain relief from bone metastasis. 
The present study aimed to identify factors affecting local control (LC) of bone 
metastasis from lung cancer and to assess the significance of moderate RT dose 
escalation. This was a retrospective cohort study, where LC of bone metastasis 
from lung cancer that had received palliative RT was reviewed. LC at RT sites 
was evaluated with follow-up computed tomography (CT). The influence of 
treatment-, cancer- and patient-related risk factors for LC was assessed. A 
total of 317 metastatic lesions in 210 patients with lung cancer were evaluated. 
The median RT dose (biologically effective dose calculated using an α/β of 10 
Gy; BED10) was 39.0 Gy (range, 14.4-50.7 Gy). The median follow-up time for 
survival and median radiographic follow-up time were 8 (range, 1-127) and 4 
(range, 1-124) months, respectively. The 0.5-year overall survival and LC rates 
were 58.9 and 87.7%, respectively. The local recurrence rate in RT sites was 
11.0%, and bone metastatic progression, except in RT sites, was observed in 
46.1% at the time of local recurrence or the last follow-up CT of the RT sites. 
According to multivariate analysis, RT sites, pre-RT neutrophil to lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR), post-RT non-administration of molecular-targeting agents (MTs), and 
non-administration of bone modifying agents (BMAs) were significant unfavorable 
factors for LC of bone metastasis. Moderate RT dose escalation (BED10 >39 Gy) 
tended to improve the LC of RT sites. In cases without MTs, moderate dose 
escalation of RT dose improved the LC of RT sites. In conclusion, treatment 
(post-RT MTs and BMAs), cancer (RT sites) and patient (pre-RT NLR)-related risk 
factors had a large impact on improving the LC of RT sites. Moderate RT dose 
escalation seemed to have a small impact on improving the LC of RT sites.",Copyright: © Makita et al.,"DOI: 10.3892/ol.2023.13889

any remaining challenges that navigation services may leave unaddressed. In this 
qualitative analysis, we used a purposeful sampling approach to conduct a 
semistructured in-person interview with 19 younger women (under 50 years at the 
time of diagnosis) at various stages of breast cancer treatment and receiving 
care that included some form of patient navigation services/within the Sutter 
Health system. Thematic analysis was performed using an inductive grounded 
theory approach. The patient experience revealed that women receiving navigation 
services throughout their cancer journey had little concern related to clinical 
decision-making and treatment. Rather, emotional, and logistical challenges 
dominate their experience and perceptions of the cancer journey. Managing 
day-to-day life and the emotional aspects of a cancer diagnosis cannot be 
disentangled from clinical care. Navigating the emotional and logistical aspects 
of the cancer journey is an ongoing unmet need for women under age 50, and 
navigation services can potentially be enhanced to help address these specific 
needs. Women with breast cancer may benefit from navigation programs focused not 
only on clinically related challenges but also on recognizing the daily needs of 
younger women and guiding them through family and job-related obstacles 
encountered while navigating cancer care. Health systems could enhance existing 
nurse navigation programs and redesign other aspects of care to focus on meeting

malignant phyllodes tumors (PTs) of the breast and construct a survival 
prediction model. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
database was used to collect information on patients with malignant breast PTs 
from 2004 to 2015. The patients were randomly divided into training and 
validation groups using R software. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses were used to screen out independent risk factors. Then, a nomogram 
model was developed in the training group and validated in the validation group, 
and the prediction performance and concordance were evaluated. Results: The 
study included 508 patients with malignant PTs of the breast, including 356 in 
the training group and 152 in the validation group. Univariate and multivariate 
Cox proportional hazard regression analyses showed that age, tumor size, tumor 
stage, regional lymph node metastasis (N), distant metastasis (M) and tumor 
grade were independent risk factors for the 5-year survival rate of patients 
with breast PTs in the training group (p < 0.05). These factors were used to 
construct the nomogram prediction model. The results showed that the C-indices 
of the training and validation groups were 0.845 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.802-0.888) and 0.784 (95% CI 0.688-0.880), respectively. The calibration 
curves of the two groups were close to the ideal 45° reference line and showed 
good performance and concordance. Receiver operating characteristic and decision 
curve analysis curves showed that the nomogram has better predictive accuracy 
than other clinical factors. Conclusion: The nomogram prediction model

diseases, and are considered as therapeutic targets for small molecules (SMs). 
Due to the time-consuming and expensive biological experiments required to 
validate SM-miRNA associations, there is an urgent need to develop new 
computational models to predict novel SM-miRNA associations. The rapid 
development of end-to-end deep learning models and the introduction of ensemble 
learning ideas provide us with new solutions. Based on the idea of ensemble 
learning, we integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) and convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs) to propose a miRNA and small molecule association prediction 
model (GCNNMMA). Firstly, we use GNNs to effectively learn the molecular 
structure graph data of small molecule drugs, while using CNNs to learn the 
sequence data of miRNAs. Secondly, since the black-box effect of deep learning 
models makes them difficult to analyze and interpret, we introduce attention 
mechanisms to address this issue. Finally, the neural attention mechanism allows 
the CNNs model to learn the sequence data of miRNAs to determine the weight of 
sub-sequences in miRNAs, and then predict the association between miRNAs and 
small molecule drugs. To evaluate the effectiveness of GCNNMMA, we implement two 
different cross-validation (CV) methods based on two different datasets. 
Experimental results show that the cross-validation results of GCNNMMA on both 
datasets are better than those of other comparison models. In a case study, 
Fluorouracil was found to be associated with five different miRNAs in the top 10 
predicted associations, and published experimental literature confirmed that 
Fluorouracil is a metabolic inhibitor used to treat liver cancer, breast cancer, 
and other tumors. Therefore, GCNNMMA is an effective tool for mining the 
relationship between small molecule drugs and miRNAs relevant to diseases.","Copyright © 2023 Niu, Gao, Xia, Zhao, Sun, Wang, Liu, Kong, Ma, Zhu, Gao, Liu,

University, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, China.","Background: Anoikis is a type of apoptosis associated with cell detachment. 
Resistance to anoikis is a focal point of tumor metastasis. This study aimed to 
explore the relationship among anoikis-related genes (ARGs), immune 
infiltration, and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: The 
transcriptome profile and clinical data on patients with CRC were retrieved from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Patients were 
divided into two clusters based on the expression of ARGs. Differences between 
the two ARG molecular subtypes were analyzed in terms of prognosis, functional 
enrichment, gene mutation frequency, and immune cell infiltration. An 
ARG-related prognostic signature for predicting overall survival in patients 
with CRC was developed and validated using absolute value convergence and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. The correlation between the 
signature risk score and clinicopathological features, immune cell infiltration, 
immune typing, and immunotherapy response was analyzed. The risk score combined 
with clinicopathological characteristics was used to construct a nomogram to 
assess CRC patients' prognosis. Results: Overall, 151 ARGs were differentially 
expressed in CRC. Two ARG subtypes, namely, ARG-high and ARG-low groups, were 
identified and correlated with CRC prognosis. The gene mutation frequency and 
immune, stromal, and ESTIMATE scores of the ARG-high group were higher than 
those of the ARG-low group. Moreover, CD8, natural killer cells, M1 macrophages, 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and immune checkpoint-related genes were 
significantly increased in the ARG-high group. An optimized 25-gene CRC 
prognostic signature was successfully constructed, and its prognostic predictive 
ability was validated. The high-risk score was correlated with T, N, M, and TNM 
stages. Risk scores were negatively correlated with dendritic cells, 
eosinophils, and CD4 cells, and significantly positively correlated with 
regulatory T cells. Patients in the high-risk group were more likely to exhibit 
immune unresponsiveness. Finally, the nomogram model was constructed and showed 
good prognostic predictive power. Conclusion: ARGs are associated with 
clinicopathological features and the prognosis of CRC, and play important roles 
in the immune microenvironment. Herein, we underpinned the usefulness of ARGs in 
CRC to develop more effective immunotherapy techniques.","Copyright © 2023 Xiao, Zhou, Chen, Liu, Wu, Li, Lin, Li, Wu and Tang.","DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2023.1186862

overall survival duration of 7-8 months, making it a fatal disease. Currently, 
chemotherapy is the major kind of treatment, but it offers little advantage. 
Repurposed conventional drugs have recently been found to offer the ability to 
control cancer with few side effects and at a reasonable cost to healthcare 
organizations. Case Presentation. In this case report, we present the case of a 
41-year-old Thai female patient diagnosed with recurrent platinum-resistant 
clear-cell ovarian cancer (PRCCC) in the year 2020. After undergoing 
chemotherapy for two courses and failing to respond to treatment, she began 
alternative medicine with repurposing drugs in November 2020. Simvastatin, 
metformin, niclosamide, mebendazole, itraconazole, loratadine, and chloroquine 
were also administered. Two months after therapy, a computerized tomography (CT) 
scan revealed a conflict between a decline in tumor marker levels (CA 125, CA 
19-9) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes. However, after continuing 
all medications for 4 months, the CA 125 level decreased from 303.6 to 54 U/ml, 
and the CA 19-9 level decreased from 1210.3 to 386.10 U/ml. The patient's 
EQ-5D-5L score increased from 0.631 to 0.829 (abdominal pain and depression), 
indicating improved quality of life. Overall survival was 8.5 months, and 
progression-free survival was 2 months.
CONCLUSION: The response to drug repurposing is demonstrated by a 
four-month-long improvement in symptoms. This work introduces a novel strategy 
for the management of recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer 
that needs further evaluation in large-scale studies.",Copyright © 2023 Woraporn Sinsuwan and Phawit Norchai.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/2079654

particularly in low-income countries. Despite the fact that antibiotics have 
provided successful management in bacterial infections, the long-term 
overconsumption and abuse of antibiotics has contributed to the emergence of 
multidrug resistant bacteria. To address this challenge, nanomaterials with 
intrinsic antibacterial properties or that serve as drug carriers have been 
substantially developed as an alternative to fight against bacterial infection. 
Systematically and deeply understanding the antibacterial mechanisms of 
nanomaterials is extremely important for designing new therapeutics. Recently, 
nanomaterials-mediated targeted bacteria depletion in either a passive or active 
manner is one of the most promising approaches for antibacterial treatment by 
increasing local concentration around bacterial cells to enhance inhibitory 
activity and reduce side effects. Passive targeting approach is widely explored 
by searching nanomaterial-based alternatives to antibiotics, while active 
targeting strategy relies on biomimetic or biomolecular surface feature that can 
selectively recognize targeted bacteria. In this review article, we summarize 
the recent developments in the field of targeted antibacterial therapy based on 
nanomaterials, which will promote more innovative thinking focusing on the 
treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria.","© 2023 The Authors. Exploration published by Henan University and John Wiley &

options in patients with head and neck cancers. A common complication of this is 
microbial colonization or infection of mucosal surfaces. These infections may 
commonly be due to bacteria or yeasts. Salivary proteins with their buffering 
activity and immunoglobulin, especially immunoglobulin A (IgA), protect oral 
tissue, mucosal surfaces, and teeth from various microorganisms. This study 
characterizes the common microorganisms encountered and evaluates the role of 
salivary IgA in predicting microbial infections in this group of patients with 
mucositis. Methods  A total of 150 adult head and neck cancer patients on CTRT 
were evaluated at baseline and at the end of 3 and 6 weeks, respectively. Oral 
swabs collected from buccal mucosa were processed in the microbiology laboratory 
for the presence of microorganisms. Saliva was processed for IgA level 
estimation on Siemens Dimension Automated biochemistry analyzer. Results   
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia e were the most common organisms 
found in our patients, followed by Escherichia coli and group A beta-hemolytic 
Streptococci . A significant increase ( p  = 0.0203) in the incidence of 
bacterial infection was observed in post-CTRT patients (61%) compared to 
pre-CTRT patients (49.33%). There was significant increase in levels of salivary 
IgA ( p  = 0.003) in patients with bacterial and fungal infection ( n 
 = 135/267) when compared to those in samples showing no growth ( n  = 66/183). 
Conclusion  A significant increase in the incidence of bacterial infection in 
post-CTRT patients was observed in this study. This study also indicated that 
postoperative head and neck cancer patients with oral mucositis that developed 
an infection were associated with high salivary IgA levels, and it may serve as 
a surrogate biomarker of infection in these patients.","The Indian Association of Laboratory Physicians. This is an open access article

Materials and Methods  This study was conducted from March 2016 to May 2019. 
Eighty-five subjects who were diagnosed with PCa for the first time, following 
transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, were included in the study. The 
prebiopsy blood samples were analyzed in Beckman Coulter Access-2 Immunoanalyzer 
for tPSA, p2PSA, and free PSA (fPSA), and the calculated parameters included

fungus Histoplasma capsulatum . Histoplasmosis is considered to be endemic to 
India, especially the Gangetic belt. Disseminated histoplasmosis may affect 
almost all systems. Disseminated histoplasmosis with asymptomatic adrenal 
involvement has been described in immunocompromised patients, whereas isolated 
adrenal involvement as the presenting manifestation in immunocompetent is 
uncommon. We aimed to determine the clinicopathological and radiological 
findings of adrenal histoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients attending a 
multispecialty diagnostic center referred from different clinics and hospitals. 
Materials and Methods  All tissue samples were initially examined 
microscopically by performing potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mounts, followed by 
culture on two tubes of Sabouraud dextrose agar and phase conversion. 
Histopathological correlation was done using tissue stains, hematoxylin and 
eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Gomori methenamine silver. Results  We 
evaluated 84 clinically suspected cases radiologically for adrenal mass. The 
pathological and microbiological work-up was done from these suspected cases. A 
total of 19 cases were evident from the tissue stain and fungal culture methods. 
The affected population were mostly above 45 years and male. Seven patients had 
bilateral adrenal involvement. All these patients received amphotericin B and/or 
itraconazole treatment, which led to symptomatic improvement in most cases. 
Conclusion  Diagnosis of invasive fungal infection requires a high index of 
suspicion, especially in immunocompetent patients presenting with nonspecific 
symptoms, clinical signs, and laboratory and radiological features that often 
resemble adrenal neoplasms. Clinical specimens, together with fungal culture, 
must be sent for cytopathology/histopathology for a definite diagnosis and

initiating AMSPs in tertiary care hospitals of India, the Indian Council of 
Medical Research envisages implementing AMSP in secondary care hospitals. This 
study is about the baseline data on antibiotic consumption in secondary care 
hospitals. Materials and Methods  It was a prospective longitudinal

consumption was captured by a 24-hour point prevalence study of antibiotic usage 
and bacterial culture rate. The prescribed antibiotics were classified according 
to the World Health Organization (WHO) Access, Watch, and Reserve 
classification. All data were collated in Microsoft Excel and summarized as 
percentages. Results  Out of the 864 patients surveyed, overall antibiotic usage 
was 78.9% (71.5% in low-priority areas vs. 92.2% in high-priority areas). Most 
of the antibiotic usage was empirical with an extremely low bacterial culture 
rate (21.9%). Out of the prescribed drugs, 53.1% were from the WHO watch 
category and 5.5% from the reserve category. Conclusion  Even after 5 years of 
the launch of the national action plan on AMR (NAP-AMR) of India, AMSP is still 
non-existent in small- and medium-level hospitals in urban cities. The 
importance of trained microbiologists in the health care system is identified as 
a fulcrum in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR); however, their absence in

arm of the immune system. The interaction of PD-1 with the ligand PD-L1 inhibits 
cytokine production and plays a role in the progression of lung cancer. The 
present study was performed to observe the expression of PD-L1 in lung carcinoma 
patients and its correlation with histopathological grade, stage, and survival 
of patients. Materials and Methods  This prospective study included all new 
cases of lung carcinoma diagnosed on histopathological or cytopathological 
examination over a period of 1 year. PD-L1 immunoexpression was statistically 
analyzed and graded according to the Tumor Proportion Score in all cases and 
correlated with histopathological grade, stage, and survival of patients. 
Results  This study included 56 cases of lung carcinoma with 64.2% cases showing 
PD-L1 positivity, out of which 44.6% were non-small cell and 19.6% were small 
cell lung carcinoma. In all, 32.1% cases with lymphovascular invasion, 53.5% 
with necrosis, and 37.5% cases with greater than 5/10 HPF mitotic figures showed 
positive PD-L1 expression. Paired cell blocks and histopathology showed 70% 
concordance for PD-L1 expression. 16.1% cT3N1M0 cases and 25% stage IIIA cases 
showed PD-L1 positivity. In all, 60.7% patients with positive PD-L1 expression 
did not survive for 12 months following diagnosis. Conclusion  PD-L1 
immunoexpression was increased in lung carcinoma cases and was associated with 
poor histomorphological features including lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, 
and increased mitotic activity. PD-L1 correlated with cases having decreased 
12-month survival and stage IIIA carcinoma. Thus, it may be useful in the

left eye revealed a hemorrhagic choroidal effusion in the nasal retinal 
periphery and low lying serous choroidal effusion in the temporal periphery. 
Complete resolution of the choroidal detachment was achieved in four days 
following prompt cessation of dorzolamide, and treatment with topical 
prednisolone acetate 1% four times daily and atropine 1% two times daily.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Topical dorzolamide may induce an idiosyncratic 
reaction leading to serous and hemorrhagic choroidal effusion, which can be 
exacerbated by antiplatelet use. Prompt recognition and management of 
drug-induced choroidal effusion can lead to improved visual outcomes and prevent 
long-term sequelae.",© 2023 The Authors.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2023.101866

exploration of their sequence and expression characteristics. We applied 
FusionInspector to thousands of tumor and normal transcriptomes and identified 
statistical and experimental features enriched among biologically impactful 
fusions. Through clustering and machine learning, we identified large 
collections of fusions potentially relevant to tumor and normal biological 
processes. We show that biologically relevant fusions are enriched for 
relatively high expression of the fusion transcript, imbalanced fusion allelic 
ratios, and canonical splicing patterns, and are deficient in sequence 
microhomologies between partner genes. We demonstrate that FusionInspector 
accurately validates fusion transcripts in silico and helps characterize 
numerous understudied fusions in tumor and normal tissue samples.

hyper and/or hypotension, hyperthermia, and encephalopathy, and its diagnosis 
and treatment are challenging.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old woman presented with hypertension, and computed 
tomography showed an adrenal tumor. Fever, shock, and impaired consciousness 
were observed, and PCC was diagnosed clinically. Systolic blood pressure 
fluctuated from 40-220 mmHg within a few minutes, and circulatory agonists were 
adjusted accordingly. The blood pressure changes gradually stabilized with 
α-blockade. Surgery was performed on hospital day 26, and the pathological 
diagnosis was consistent with a pheochromocytoma. She was discharged on hospital 
day 37.
CONCLUSION: Computed tomography may facilitate early diagnosis in the acute 
phase of PCC in case of limited patient medical information and insufficient 
time to wait for a definitive diagnosis using traditional hormone tests. The 
shock requires pharmacological therapy to maintain circulation, and 
paradoxically, the administration of α-blockade can be lifesaving.","© 2023 The Authors. Acute Medicine & Surgery published by John Wiley & Sons

subtype. It is characterized by the deficient expression of the three main 
receptors implicated in breast cancers, making it unresponsive to hormone 
therapy. Hence, an existing need to develop a targeted molecular therapy for 
TNBC. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway mediates critical cellular processes, 
including cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. It is activated in 
approximately 10-21% of TNBCs, emphasizing the importance of this intracellular 
target in TNBC treatment. AKT is a prominent driver of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway, validating it as a promising therapeutic target. Dysphania ambrosioides 
is an important ingredient of Nigeria's traditional herbal recipe for cancer 
treatment. Thus, our present study explores its anticancer properties through a 
structure-based virtual screening of 25 biologically active compounds domiciled 
in the plant. Interestingly, our molecular docking study identified several 
potent inhibitors of AKT 1 and 2 isoforms from D. ambrosioides. However, 
cynaroside and epicatechin gallate having a binding energy of - 9.9 
and - 10.2 kcal/mol for AKT 1 and 2, respectively, demonstrate considerable 
drug-likeness than the reference drug (capivasertib), whose respective binding 
strengths for AKT 1 and 2 are - 9.5 and - 8.4 kcal/mol. Lastly, the molecular 
dynamics simulation experiment showed that the simulated complex systems of the 
best hits exhibit structural stability throughout the 50 ns run. Together, our 
computational modeling analysis suggests that these compounds could emerge as 
efficacious drug candidates in the treatment of TNBC. Nevertheless, further 
experimental, translational, and clinical research is required to establish an 
empirical clinical application.

major impact on aging biology. Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) in blood cells 
is a common chromosomal abnormality in aging men and is considered an indicator 
of genomic instability. Previous studies have indicated a connection between 
mLOY and prostate cancer risk, but the causal relationship has not been fully 
established. Methods: To determine the causal effect of mLOY on prostate cancer, 
we conducted a Mendelian Randomization (MR) study in two ancestral groups. We 
utilized 125 and 42 mLOY-associated variants as instrumental variables (IVs) in 
European and East Asian GWAS of prostate cancer, respectively. Summary-level 
data on prostate cancer was obtained from the PRACTICAL consortium (79,148 cases 
and 61,106 controls of European ancestry) and the Biobank Japan consortium 
(5,408 cases and 103,939 controls of East Asian ancestry). A single population 
was used to assess the causal relationship in East Asian ancestry. Our main 
method for obtaining MR results was inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and we 
conducted sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness of our results. 
Finally, we combined the estimates from both sources using a fixed-effects 
meta-analysis. Results: Our MR analysis using the IVW method showed that a 
one-unit increase in genetically predicted mLOY was associated with an increased 
risk of prostate cancer in the PRACTICAL consortium (OR = 1.09%, 95% CI: 
1.05-1.13, p = 1.2 × 10-5), but not in the Biobank Japan consortium (OR = 1.13%, 
95% CI: 0.88-1.45, p = 0.34). Sensitivity analyses robustly indicated increased 
odds ratios for prostate cancer with every one-unit increase in genetically 
predicted mLOY for the PRACTICAL consortium. Furthermore, mLOY was found to be 
associated with prostate cancer risk in a meta-analysis of both sources (OR = 
1.09%, 95% CI: 1.05-1.13, p = 8.0 × 10-6). Conclusion: Our MR study provides 
strong evidence that higher mLOY increases the risk of prostate cancer. 
Preventing mLOY may be a means of reducing the risk of developing prostate 
cancer.","Copyright © 2023 Kobayashi, Hachiya, Ikehata and Horie.","DOI: 10.3389/fragi.2023.1176451

clinical updates regarding the association between coffee consumption and 
cardiovascular disease. Methods: We present a narrative review of the literature 
related to coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease. Results: Recent 
(2000-2021) studies have shown that regular coffee consumption is associated 
with a decreased risk of developing hypertension, heart failure, and atrial 
fibrillation. However, results are inconsistent with regard to coffee 
consumption and risk of developing coronary heart disease. Most studies show a 
J-shaped association, wherein moderate coffee consumption resulted in decreased 
risk of coronary heart disease and heavy coffee consumption resulted in 
increased risk. In addition, boiled or unfiltered coffee is more atherogenic 
than filtered coffee because of its rich diterpene content that inhibits bile 
acid synthesis and ultimately affects lipid metabolism. On the other hand, 
filtered coffee, which is essentially devoid of the aforementioned compounds, 
exerts antiatherogenic properties by increasing high-density 
lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages through the influence 
of plasma phenolic acid. As such, cholesterol levels are principally influenced 
by the manner of coffee preparation (boiled vs filtered). Conclusion: Our 
findings suggest that moderate coffee consumption leads to a decrease in 
all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality, hypertension, cholesterol, heart 
failure, and atrial fibrillation. However, no conclusive relationship between 
coffee and coronary heart disease risk has been consistently identified.",©2023 by the author(s); Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).,"DOI: 10.31486/toj.22.0073

patients with colon cancer, frailty is associated with increased morbidity after 
resection. One commonly cited reason for performing an end colostomy vs a 
primary anastomosis in left-sided colon cancer is the belief that frail patients 
do not have the physiologic reserve to withstand the morbidity associated with 
an anastomotic leak. We explored the impact of frailty on the type of operation 
performed in patients with left-sided colon cancer. Methods: We queried the 
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for 
patients with colon cancer who underwent a left-sided colectomy from 2016 to 
2018. Patients were categorized using the modified 5-item frailty index. 
Multivariate regression was used to identify independent predictors of 
complications and type of operation performed. Results: Of 17,461 patients, 
20.7% were considered frail. Frail patients received an end colostomy more often 
than nonfrail patients (11.3% vs 9.6%, P=0.01). On multivariate analysis, 
frailty was a significant predictor for total medical complications (odds ratio 
[OR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.29-1.63) and readmission (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.32-1.77) but was 
not independently associated with organ space surgical site infections or 
reoperation. Frailty was independently associated with receiving an end 
colostomy vs a primary anastomosis (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.44), but an end 
colostomy did not decrease the risk of reoperation or organ space surgical site 
infections. Conclusion: Frail patients with left-sided colon cancer are more 
likely to receive an end colostomy, but an end colostomy does not lower the risk 
of reoperation or organ space surgical site infections. Based on these results, 
frailty alone should not prompt the decision to perform an end colostomy, but 
further studies are needed to guide surgical decision-making in this 
understudied population.",©2023 by the author(s); Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).,"DOI: 10.31486/toj.22.0120

asymptomatic, others may experience a range of symptoms, including headaches, 
seizures, focal neurological deficits, changes in baseline mental function, and 
psychiatric manifestations. Distinguishing between a primary psychiatric illness 
and symptoms of a primary central nervous system tumor can be especially 
difficult for patients with a history of mental illness. A major challenge in 
effectively treating patients with brain tumors is first obtaining the 
diagnosis. Case Report: A 61-year-old female with a medical history significant 
for bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features, generalized anxiety, and 
previous psychiatric hospitalization presented to the emergency department with 
worsening depressive symptoms and without focal neurologic deficits. She was 
initially placed on a physician's emergency certificate for grave disability, 
with anticipated discharge to a local inpatient psychiatric facility once she 
was stabilized. A frontal brain lesion, concerning for a meningioma, was found 
on magnetic resonance imaging and she was instead transferred to a tertiary 
center for urgent neurosurgical consultation. Bifrontal craniotomy with neoplasm 
excision was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and 
continued symptom improvement was noted at the patient's 6- and 12-week 
postoperative visits. Conclusion: This patient's clinical course exemplifies the 
clinical ambiguity associated with brain tumors, the challenge of obtaining a 
timely diagnosis with nonspecific symptoms, and the importance of neuroimaging 
for patients presenting with atypical cognitive symptoms. This case report 
contributes to the literature about the psychiatric manifestations of brain 
lesions, especially in patients with concurrent mental health disorders.",©2023 by the author(s); Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).,"DOI: 10.31486/toj.22.0112

biopsy, a noninvasive technique that allows the study of circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs) and biomolecules involved in the dynamics of cancer spread like cell-free 
nucleid acids or tumor-derived extracellular vesicles. However, single-cell 
isolation of CTCs with high viability for further genetic, phenotypic, and 
morphological characterization remains a challenge. We present a new approach 
for single CTC isolation in enriched blood samples using a liquid laser transfer 
(LLT) process, adapted from standard laser direct write techniques. In order to 
completely preserve the cells from direct laser irradiation, we used an 
ultraviolet laser to produce a blister-actuated laser-induced forward transfer 
process (BA-LIFT). Using a plasma-treated polyimide layer for blister 
generation, we completely shield the sample from the incident laser beam. The 
optical transparency of the polyimide allows direct cell targeting using a 
simplified optical setup, in which the laser irradiation module, standard 
imaging, and fluorescence imaging share a common optical path. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were identified by fluorescent markers, while target 
cancer cells remained unstained. As a proof of concept, we were able to isolate 
single MDA-MB-231 cancer cells using this negative selection process. Unstained 
target cells were isolated and culture while their DNA was sent for single-cell 
sequencing (SCS). Our approach appears to be an effective approach to isolate 
single CTCs, preserving cell characteristics in terms of cell viability and 
potential for further SCS.","Copyright: © 2023, Molpeceres C, Ramos-Medina R, Marquez A, et al.","DOI: 10.18063/ijb.720

tissue engineering and has recently been employed for generating bioprinted 
solid tumors to be used as cancer models to test therapeutics. In pediatrics, 
neural crest-derived tumors are the most common type of extracranial solid 
tumors. There are only a few tumor-specific therapies that directly target these 
tumors, and the lack of new therapies remains detrimental to improving the 
outcomes for these patients. The absence of more efficacious therapies for 
pediatric solid tumors, in general, may be due to the inability of the currently 
employed preclinical models to recapitulate the solid tumor phenotype. In this 
study, we utilized 3D bioprinting to generate neural crest-derived solid tumors. 
The bioprinted tumors consisted of cells from established cell lines and 
patient-derived xenograft tumors mixed with a 6% gelatin/1% sodium alginate 
bioink. The viability and morphology of the bioprints were analyzed via 
bioluminescence and immunohisto chemistry, respectively. We compared the 
bioprints to traditional twodimensional (2D) cell culture under conditions such 
as hypoxia and therapeutics. We successfully produced viable neural 
crest-derived tumors that retained the histology and immunostaining 
characteristics of the original parent tumors. The bioprinted tumors propagated 
in culture and grew in orthotopic murine models. Furthermore, compared to cells 
grown in traditional 2D culture, the bioprinted tumors were resistant to hypoxia 
and chemotherapeutics, suggesting that the bioprints exhibited a phenotype that 
is consistent with that seen clinically in solid tumors, thus potentially making 
this model superior to traditional 2D culture for preclinical investigations. 
Future applications of this technology entail the potential to rapidly print 
pediatric solid tumors for use in high-throughput drug studies, expediting the 
identification of novel, individualized therapies.","Copyright: © 2023, Quinn CH, Beierle AM, Julson JR, et al.","DOI: 10.18063/ijb.723

developed a novel plug-in algorithm to optimize the risk-adjusted clinical

also decreased the fold of antibiotic resistance genes expression. The NPs 
showed potent cytotoxic activities for MCF-7, HepG2 and A549 cancer cell lines

radiation and fewer views, however, leads to inferior image reconstruction. To 
solve this sparse-view problem, a deep-learning model is created that takes as

additional views. The architecture of this model is based on the 
super-resolution convolutional neural network. The reconstruction of 
model-interpolated sinograms has less mean-squared error than the reconstruction 
of the sparse sinogram. It also has less mean-squared error than a

decades to treat various diseases. The importance of gene therapy as an 
alternative to traditional drugs has increased after the discovery of gene-based 
drugs such as Gendicine for cancer and Neovasculgen for peripheral artery 
disease. Since then, the pharma sector is focusing on developing gene-based 
drugs for various diseases. After the discovery of the RNA interference (RNAi) 
mechanism, the development of siRNA-based gene therapy has been accelerated 
immensely. siRNA-based treatment for hereditary transthyretin-mediated 
amyloidosis (hATTR) using Onpattro and acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) by Givlaari 
and three more FDA-approved siRNA drugs has set up a milestone and further 
improved the confidence for the development of gene therapeutics for a spectrum 
of diseases. siRNA-based gene drugs have more advantages over other gene 
therapies and are under study to treat different types of diseases such as viral 
infections, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and many more. However, there are a 
few bottlenecks to realizing the full potential of siRNA-based gene therapy. 
They include chemical instability, nontargeted biodistribution, undesirable 
innate immune responses, and off-target effects. This review provides a

(1)Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Medicine, Instituto Português de 
Oncologia do Porto Francisco Gentil, EPE, Porto, PRT.","Background Opioids have long been the cornerstone of drugs used for 
perioperative analgesia. Sufentanil has an advantageous pharmacological profile 
for its use in continuous intravenous (IV) infusion, yet remains poorly 
described. Our institution has implemented analgesia protocols with IV 
sufentanil infusions for cancer surgery with appropriate monitoring. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV sufentanil infusion. 
Methods A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted through the 
analysis of patients' records and the acute pain service database. Inclusion 
criteria were adult patients admitted for elective cancer surgery and with 
postoperative IV sufentanil infusion during one year period. Descriptive and 
inferential statistical analysis was performed by using Software SPSS Statistics 
(IBM Corp., Armonk USA): Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square and Fisher 
tests; Bonferroni chi-square residual analysis, binary logistic regression; 
p<0.05. Results The study population of 304 patients had a median age of 66 
years (22-91) and 229 (75.3%) were men. 38 (12.5%) were chronic opioid users. 
Head and neck/otorhinolaryngology (ORL) surgery was performed in 155 (51.0%) and 
abdominopelvic surgery in 123 (40.5%). The median days of IV sufentanil infusion 
were 2 (1-13). At rest and with movement, analgesia was considered good, i.e., 
over 90% of patients with visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score ≤ 3. We found 
that patients submitted to musculoskeletal surgery had higher VAS pain scores; 
this group also presented older patients with higher American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification and more chronic opioid 
users (p<0.05). 144 patients (47.4%) had at least one adverse effect related to 
IV sufentanil infusion, notably transient and not requiring any specific 
treatment. These patients were older and had longer infusion periods 
(p<0.05). 237 (98.3%) of the adverse effects occurred during the first 3 days 
and the most common were: sedation (n=104, 42.8%), hypotension (n=32, 13.2%), 
hypoxemia (n=31, 12.8%) and nausea/vomiting (n=25, 10.3%). The reported 
incidence of respiratory depression was 2.9% (n=9), with three patients (1%) 
requiring advanced treatment. Conclusion Multimodal analgesic protocols with IV 
sufentanil infusions provided good postoperative analgesia for head and neck/ORL 
and abdominopelvic cancer surgeries. The adverse effects associated with the IV 
sufentanil infusions were mild and mainly managed with opioid dose reductions. 
Our study showed that this approach can be a safe option for postoperative 
multimodal analgesia in cancer surgery with appropriate monitoring in 
high-dependency units.","Copyright © 2023, Dias et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.38993

diarrhea transmitted by the fecal-oral route. C. difficile type BI/NAP1/027 is 
responsible for the most severe C. difficile infection (CDI). It is a major 
cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea followed by Clostridium 
perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus,and Klebsiella oxytoca. Historically, 
clindamycin, cephalosporins, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones were related to 
CDI. We conducted this study to evaluate the antibiotics associated with CDI in 
recent times. Methods We conducted a retrospective, single-center study over a 
period of eight years. A total of 58 patients were enrolled in the study. 
Patients with diarrhea and positive C. difficile toxin in stool were evaluated 
for antibiotics given, age, presence of malignancy, previous hospital stay for 
more than three days in the last three months, and any comorbidities. Results 
Among patients who developed CDI, prior antibiotics for at least four days 
duration were given in 93% (54/58) of patients. The most common antibiotics 
associated with C. difficile infection were piperacillin/tazobactam in 77.60% 
(45/58), meropenem in 27.60% (16/58), vancomycin in 20.70% (12/58), 
ciprofloxacin in 17.20% (10/58), ceftriaxone in 16% (9/58), and levofloxacin in 
14% (8/58) of patients, respectively. Seven percent (7%) of patients with CDI 
did not receive any prior antibiotics. Solid organ malignancy was present 
in 67.20% and hematological malignancy in 27.60% of CDI patients. Ninety-eight 
percent (98%, 57/58) of patients treated with proton pump inhibitors, 93% of 
patients with a previous hospital stay for more than three days, 24% of patients 
with neutropenia, 20.1% of patients aged more than 65 years, 14% of patients 
with diabetes mellitus, and 12% of patients with chronic kidney disease also 
developed C. difficile infection. Conclusion The antibiotics associated with C. 
difficile infection are piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, vancomycin, 
ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. Other risk factors for CDI are 
proton pump inhibitor use, prior hospital admission, solid organ malignancy, 
neutropenia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).","Copyright © 2023, Rafey et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.39029

hepatomegaly to the right iliac fossa region with no focal lesion. Bone marrow 
aspiration and bone marrow biopsy showed heavy infiltration by monomorphic 
cells. Moreover, liver biopsy was done for this patient, and it showed 
metastatic undifferentiated neuroblastoma. Before the liver biopsy results, the

Hypertension (ISH) risk prediction charts are useful for predicting 10-year 
combined myocardial infarction and stroke risk (fatal and non-fatal). Hence the 
current study was conducted to assess the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease 
among adults in Ahmedabad, India.
AIMS: The primary aim of the study was to assess the cardiovascular risk among 
first-degree relatives of patients attending the outpatient clinic. Also, to 
create awareness regarding assessment of cardiovascular risk among the studied 
group.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 372 
first-degree relatives of patients at an out-patient cardiology clinic present 
in Vadaj, Ahmedabad. The WHO/ISH risk prediction chart for South-East Asia 
Region D (SEAR D) was used for calculating the 10-year cardiovascular risk.
RESULTS: A maximum (80.10%) of the study participants were in the low-risk 
(<10%) category followed by 8.33% for moderate-risk (10-20%), 7.25% for 
moderately high-risk (20-30%), 2.42% for high-risk (30-40%) and 1.88% for very 
high-risk (>40%).
CONCLUSION: WHO/ISH risk prediction charts provide a quick and effective way to 
assess and categorize the population in a low-resource setting which in turn 
helps in delivering focused intervention to the high-risk groups.","Copyright © 2023, Prajapati et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.39061

affecting mainly women of reproductive age. However, no data exist about its 
association with endometrial or uterine disorders. This study aimed to assess 
the risk of hyperproliferative pathology of the reproductive system in female ТС 
survivors.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of female patients aged 20-45 years 
diagnosed with papillary TC (PTC) from 1994-2018. Age-matched females with 
normal thyroid structures served as controls.
RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen patients (mean age 36.7±61 years) and 90 
age-matched controls were included. PTC survivors demonstrated an increased risk 
for adenomyosis [odds ratio (OR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-4.8] and 
endometrial hyperplasia (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-14.3), compared with controls. The 
risk for adenomyosis was higher after the ten post-operative years (OR 5.3, 95% 
CI 2.29- 12.05) than during the first 5-10 years (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.02-5.10) and 
increased with the number of RAI courses and the degree of TSH suppression. The 
risk of endometrial hyperplasia was most evident during the first five years 
post-thyroidectomy (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.4-25.5), especially in patients with TSH 
<0.1 mU/L (OR 6.8, 95% CI 1.4-33.28) No difference in uterine leiomyomas or 
endometrial polyps was found between PTC survivors and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Female PTC survivors are at increased risk of endometrial 
hyperplasia and adenomyosis compared with those with normal thyroid structures.","Copyright © 2023, Tatarchuk et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.38989

due to its increased incidence among younger individuals, particularly in areas 
with limited healthcare access and funding, such as in countries with a low 
sociodemographic index (SDI). However, there are limited studies regarding this 
problem. Therefore, our study primarily aims to address the dearth of knowledge 
in this area by assessing the trends in EOCRC in low SDI countries over 10 
years. Methods In this study, we analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019 to investigate the changes in EOCRC over time in low SDI countries. 
Our analysis involved determining the yearly frequencies and age-standardized 
rates (ASRs) of EOCRC incidence, death, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) by gender. Results In 2019, the number of newly diagnosed EOCRC cases in 
low SDI countries was 7,716, while the global cases were 225,736. The incidence 
rates of EOCRC increased significantly higher in low SDI countries compared to 
the global average between 2010 and 2019, with a 1.38-fold higher increase among 
females. Mortality rates and DALYs also increased in the low SDI countries, with 
the annual percentage change from 2010 to 2019 of 0.96 (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI): 0.88-1.03) and 0.91 (95% UI: 0.83-0.98), respectively. Conclusion Our 
research highlights a significant rise in CRC in low SDI countries, particularly 
in the female population. Therefore, it emphasizes the need for prompt and 
efficient interventions, including but not limited to effective screening 
methods and mitigation of risk factors.","Copyright © 2023, Danpanichkul et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.38998

illness in the general population. Although the incidence of CRC is steadily 
decreasing worldwide, it is being diagnosed more in individuals under 50 years 
of age. Multiple disease-causing variants have been reported to be involved in 
the development of CRC. This study aimed to investigate the molecular and 
clinical characteristics of Thai patients with CRC. Methods NGS-based multigene 
cancer panel testing was performed on 21 unrelated patients. Target enrichment 
was performed using a custom-designed Ion AmpliSeq on-demand panel. Thirty-six 
genes associated with CRC and other cancer were analyzed for variant detection. 
Results Sixteen variants (five nonsense, eight missense, two deletions, and one 
duplication) in nine genes were identified in 12 patients. Eight (66.7%) 
patients harboring disease-causing deleterious variants in genes APC, ATM, 
BRCA2, MSH2, and MUTYH. One of the eight patients also carried additional 
heterozygous variants in genes ATM, BMPR1A, and MUTYH. In addition, four 
patients carried variants of uncertain significance in genes APC, MLH1, MSH2, 
STK11, and TP53. Among all detected genes, APC was the most frequent causative 
gene observed in CRC patients, which is consistent with previous reports.

outside of the uterus. The condition is often attributed to estrogen imbalance 
and can lead to severe inflammation and bleeding, where it is believed that 10% 
of female patients experience this illness. Endometrial growth can occur in the 
ovaries, fallopian tubes, stomach, and gastrointestinal tract. Twelve percent of 
endometriosis cases can be seen in the intestines, with the rectosigmoid colon 
accounting for 72% of these cases. Patients with intestinal endometriosis may 
present with moderate symptoms, such as constipation, but they may experience 
more serious complications as well such as intestinal bleeding. Although the 
presence of endometrial tissue in the colon is already a rare phenomenon, it is 
even rarer for endometrial growth to perforate the entire mucosa of the sigmoid 
colon. A study in 2010 reported that only 21 of such cases have occurred since 
1931. The patient in this case report had a gene (MUTYH) mutation that put her 
at risk for colorectal cancer, and she was ultimately treated with segmental 
resection of the sigmoid colon. The final pathology of the specimen revealed 
that the patient's lesion was endometrial growth. In this case report, we 
present a rare finding of endometrial tissue perforating through a patient's 
intestinal lumen, which was successfully treated with surgical intervention.","Copyright © 2023, Do et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.39038

among women worldwide. Given the growing concern, cervical cancer awareness 
month (CCAM) in January and Breast cancer awareness month (BCAM) in October 
occur annually as global health observances to raise public awareness. This 
infodemiology study aimed to assess trends in public online searches for breast 
cancer and cervical cancer following the annual BCAM and CCAM from 2008 to 2021.
METHODS: Google Trends (GT) was used to investigate online searches for ""breast 
cancer"" and ""cervical cancer"" from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2021. (168 
months). A joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify statistically 
significant weekly percentage changes (WPCs) and monthly percentage changes 
(MPCs) trends over time.
RESULTS: Breast cancer searches increased in October (BCAM) every year, while 
cervical cancer searches increased in January (CCAM) in 2013, 2019, and 2020. 
Joinpoint regression analysis revealed a significant negative trend in ""breast 
cancer"" searches from 2008 to 2021 (MPC: -0.2%, 95% CI: -0.3 to -0.1) and an 
upward trend in ""cervical cancer"" searches from May 2017 to December 2021 (MPC: 
0.5%, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.7).
CONCLUSION: Online searches on ""breast cancer"" remain consistently high only 
during BCAM, and ""cervical cancer"" has increased by 0.5% MPC since May 2017. Our 
findings can inform online interventions like event-based opportunities (BCAM 
and CCAM) and Google Ads to raise public awareness of breast and cervical 
cancer.","Copyright © 2023, Bhagavathula et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.39035

conversion therapy strategy (high-intensity combined with multiple treatment 
modalities) can be used.
ABSTRACT: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy 
worldwide. The best treatment for HCC is radical surgical resection, but 70%-80% 
of patients are ineligible for surgery. Although conversion therapy is an 
established treatment strategy for various solid tumors, there is no uniform 
protocol for treating HCC. In this case, we present a 69-year-old male patient 
diagnosed with massive HCC with Barcelona clinical liver cancer (BCLC) stage B. 
Because of the insufficient volume of the future liver remnant, we believed 
radical surgical resection was temporarily impossible. Therefore, the patient 
received conversion therapy, including four cycles of transcatheter arterial 
embolization (TAE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC-Folfox), 
lenvatinib (8 mg orally once a day), and tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody, 
200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks). Fortunately, the patient achieved a 
good treatment response (smaller lesions and improved liver function) and 
underwent radical surgery finally. There was no clinical evidence of recurrence 
at 6 months of follow-up. For potentially resectable HCC, this case reveals that 
a more aggressive conversion therapy strategy (high-intensity combined with 
multiple treatment modalities) can be used.",© 2023 The Authors. Clinical Case Reports published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/ccr3.7533

often considered to be incurable. Since the expression of amphoterin-induced 
gene and open reading frame 2 (AMIGO2) in clinical samples is a prognostic 
factor for colorectal cancer and gastric cancer, the present aimed to elucidate 
whether it is also a prognostic factor for cervical cancer. Patients with 
primary cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy or radical 
trachelectomy at our institution (Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, 
Yonago, Japan) between September 2005 and October 2016 were retrospectively 
collected. Immunohistochemical analysis using a specific antibody against AMIGO2 
was performed on 101 tumor samples, and the clinical characteristics, 
disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients were 
examined. Patients in the AMIGO2-high group had a shorter 5-year DFS and OS than 
those in the AMIGO2-low group (P<0.001). Furthermore, AMIGO2 was an independent 
prognostic factor for DFS in multivariate analysis (P=0.0012). Patients in the 
AMIGO2-high group exhibited obvious recurrence compared with those in the 
AMIGO2-low group in the high-(P=0.03) and intermediate-risk groups (P=0.003). 
Positive lymph node metastasis, and parametrial, stromal and lymph vascular 
space invasion were significantly more common in AMIGO2-high patients. Taken 
together, AMIGO2 expression may be a predictive marker of recurrence for 
cervical cancer. In particular, it may be an indicator to determine the need for 
postoperative adjuvant therapy in intermediate-risk group patients.",Copyright: © Iida et al.,"DOI: 10.3892/mco.2023.2652

endometrial cancer incidence is alarming. The aim of the present review is to 
focus on endometrial cancer affecting young women of reproductive age. Surgery, 
namely abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, with or without 
salpingo-oophorectomy, and sentinel lymph node detection has become the standard 
surgical strategy for early stage endometrioid endometrial cancer. However, 
premenopausal women might want to preserve their fertility, especially if they 
are nulliparous or have not reached their desired number of children at the time 
of diagnosis. Conservative, uterus-sparing treatment, based on progestin 
products, may be an advantageous option for patients meeting the necessary 
criteria. Potential candidates have to be committed to following a rigorous 
protocol of treatment, investigations and follow-up. The evidence in favor of 
this approach, although limited, is encouraging and patients who have achieved a 
histologically documented disease complete remission could attempt to conceive 
spontaneously or with the immediate use of assisted reproductive technology 
techniques. The risk of partial or negative response to progestin treatment or 
cancer recurrence is well documented, thus patients have to be aware of the

variation among Florida Fee for Service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries between 
2016 and 2018.
DATA SOURCES: This study analyzed HCC risk score variation using Medicare claims 
data for Florida beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A & B between 2016 and 2018.
STUDY DESIGN: The CMS methodology analyzed HCC risk score variation using annual 
mean county- and beneficiary-level risk score changes. The association between 
variation and beneficiary characteristics, diagnoses, and geographic location 
was characterized using mixed-effects negative binomial regression models.
DATA COLLECTION: Not applicable.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Counties in the Northeast [marginal effect (ME)=-0.003], 
Central (ME=-0.021), and Southwest (ME=-0.009) Florida have relatively lower 
mean risk scores. A higher number of lifetime (ME=0.246) and treatable 
(ME=0.288) conditions were associated with higher county-level risk scores, 
while more preventable conditions (ME=-0.249) were associated with lower risk 
scores. Counties with older beneficiaries (ME=0.015) and more Blacks (ME=0.070) 
have higher risk scores, while having female beneficiaries reduced risk scores 
(ME=-0.005). Individual risk scores did not vary by age (ME=0.000), but Blacks 
(ME=0.001) had higher rates of variation relative to Whites, while other races 
had comparatively lower variation (ME=-0.003). In addition, individuals 
diagnosed with more lifetime (ME=0.129), treatable (ME=0.235), and preventable 
(ME=0.001) conditions had higher risk score variation. Most condition-specific 
indicators showed small associations with risk score changes; however, 
metastatic cancer/acute leukemia, respirator dependence/tracheostomy, and 
pressure ulcers of the skin were significantly associated with both types of HCC 
risk score variation.
CONCLUSION: Results showed demographics, HCC condition classifications (ie, 
lifetime, preventable, and treatable), and some specific conditions were 
associated with higher variation in mean county-level and individual risk 
scores. Results suggest consistent coding and reductions in the prevalence of 
certain treatable or preventable conditions could reduce the county and

tubular cells, raising the possibility of radiation-induced nephrotoxicity, and 
this level of renal impairment would typically exclude the patient from

tumor response to induction chemotherapy (IC) could be used to guide the 
risk-adapted treatment strategy of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (LANPC) before concurrent chemoradiotherapy. We aim to compare the 
efficacy and safety of concurrent chemotherapy using taxane plus cisplatin 
[double-agent concurrent chemotherapy (DACC) group] with those of cisplatin 
alone [single-agent concurrent chemotherapy (SACC) group] in high-risk LANPC.
METHODS: Overall, 197 LANPC patients with detectable EBV DNA or stable disease 
(SD) after IC were retrospectively included. Potential confounders between the 
DACC and SACC groups were adjusted by propensity score matching. Short-term 
efficacy and long-term survival were assessed in the two groups.
RESULTS: Although the objective response rate of the DACC group was marginally 
higher than that of the SACC group, the difference was not significant (92.7% 
versus 85.3%, p = 0.38). Concerning long-term survival, DACC did not show 
superiority to SACC after patient matching: 3-year progression-free survival: 
87.8% versus 81.7%, p = 0.80; overall survival: 97.6% versus 97.3%, p = 0.48; 
distant metastasis-free survival: 87.8% versus 90.5%, p = 0.64, and; 
locoregional relapse-free survival: 92.3% versus 86.9%, p = 0.77. The incidence 
of grade 1-4 hematological toxicities was significantly higher in the DACC 
group.
CONCLUSION: Due to the small sample size, we do not have sufficient evidence 
that concurrent chemotherapy using taxane plus cisplatin provides additional 
survival benefits in LANPC patients with an unfavorable response (detectable EBV 
DNA levels or SD) after IC. But concurrent taxane and cisplatin chemotherapy is 
associated with a higher rate of hematologic adverse events. Further clinical 
trials will be required to establish evidence and identify more effective 
treatment modalities for high-risk LANPC patients.","© The Author(s), 2023.","DOI: 10.1177/17588359231177016

study is the first trial to identify novel predictive biomarkers for longer 
treatment efficacy of afatinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutation-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via a comprehensive 
association study using genomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic 
analyses.
OBJECTIVES: We report details of the clinical portion prior to omics analyses.
DESIGN: A prospective, single-arm, observational study was conducted using 
afatinib 40 mg/day as an initial dose in untreated patients with EGFR 
mutation-positive NSCLC. Dose reduction to 20 mg every other day was allowed.
METHODS: Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse 
events (AEs) were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (median age 70 years, range 42-88 years) were 
enrolled from 21 institutions in Japan between February 2017 and March 2018. 
After a median follow-up of 35.0 months, 21% remained on afatinib treatment, 
whereas 9% had discontinued treatment because of AEs. The median PFS was 
18.4 months, with a 3-year PFS rate of 23.3%. The median afatinib treatment 
duration in patients with final doses of 40 (n = 27), 30 (n = 23), and 20 mg/day 
(n = 35), and 20 mg every other day (n = 18) were 13.4, 15.4, 18.8, and 
18.3 months, respectively. The median OS was not reached, with a 3-year OS rate 
of 58.5%. The median OS in patients who did (n = 25) and did not (n = 78) 
receive osimertinib during the entire course of treatment were 42.4 months and 
not reached, respectively (p = 0.654).
CONCLUSIONS: As the largest prospective study in Japan, this study confirmed 
favorable OS following first-line afatinib in patients with EGFR 
mutation-positive NSCLC in a real-world setting. Further analysis of the EXTRA 
study is expected to identify novel predictive biomarkers for afatinib.

progressively become polyclonal, with very different genotypic and phenotypic 
characteristics leading to biological differences, including the Ki-67 
proliferation index, morphology, or sensitivity to treatments. Whereas 
inter-patient heterogeneity has been well described, intra-tumor heterogeneity 
has been little studied. However, NENs present a high degree of heterogeneity, 
both spatially within the same location or between different lesions, and 
through time. This can be explained by the emergence of tumor subclones with 
different behaviors. These subpopulations can be distinguished by the Ki-67 
index, but also by the expression of hormonal markers or by differences in the 
intensity of uptake on metabolic imaging, such as 68Ga-somatostatin receptor and 
Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. As these features 
are directly related to prognosis, it seems mandatory to move toward a 
standardized, improved selection of the tumor areas to be studied to be as 
predictive as possible. The temporal evolution of NENs frequently leads to 
changes in tumor grade over time, with impact on prognosis and therapeutic 
decision-making. However, there is no recommendation regarding systematic biopsy 
of NEN recurrence or progression, and which lesion to sample. This review aims 
to summarize the current state of knowledge, the main hypotheses, and the main 
implications regarding intra-tumor spatial and temporal heterogeneity in 
digestive NENs.","© The Author(s), 2023.","DOI: 10.1177/17588359231179310

hormonal-agent setting in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer. As a beta-emitting radioligand targeting prostate-specific membrane 
antigen (PSMA), it delivers radiation to cells expressing PSMA on their surface. 
In pivotal clinical trials, patients were selected for this treatment based on 
positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging, requiring PSMA-avid disease with 
no evidence of discordant disease on 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT or 
contrast CT scan. Despite exhibiting an optimal imaging phenotype, the response 
for many patients is not durable, and a minority do not respond to 
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA at all. Disease progression is inevitable even for those who 
achieve an exceptional initial response. Reasons for both primary and acquired 
resistance are largely unknown; however, they are likely due to the presence of 
underlying PSMA-negative disease not identified on imaging, molecular factors 
conferring radioresistance, and inadequate delivery of lethal radiation, 
particularly to sites of micrometastatic disease. Biomarkers are urgently needed 
to optimize patient selection for treatment with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA by identifying 
those who are most and least likely to respond. Retrospective data support using 
several prognostic and predictive baseline patient- and disease-related 
parameters; however, robust prospective data is required before these can be 
translated into widespread use. Further, early on-treatment clinical parameters 
(in addition to serial prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels and conventional 
restaging imaging) may serve as surrogates for predicting treatment response. 
With little known about the efficacy of treatments given after [177Lu]Lu-PSMA, 
optimal treatment sequencing is paramount, and biomarker-driven patient 
selection will hopefully improve treatment and survival outcomes.","© The Author(s), 2023.","DOI: 10.1177/17588359231179309

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Annexin A9 (ANXA9) has been proved to be concerned with cancer 
development. However, to explore the clinical consequences of ANXA9 in lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), especially its correlation to spinal metastasis (SM) has 
no in-depth study. The study was expected to elucidate the mechanism of ANXA9 in 
regulating SM of LUAD and create a productive nano-composites delivery system 
targeting this gene for treatment of SM.
METHODS: Harmine (HM), a β-carboline extracted from the traditional Chinese herb 
Peganum harmala, loaded Au@MSNs@PEG@Asp6 (NPS) nano-composites were synthesized. 
Bioinformatics analysis and clinical specimens' tests were used to verify the 
association between ANXA9 and prognosis of LUAD with SM. The 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to detect the expression levels of the 
ANXA9 protein in LUAD tissues with or without SM, and its significance in clinic 
was also explored. ANXA9‑siRNA was applied to investigate the molecular 
mechanism of ANXA9 in tumor behaviors. The HM release kinetics was detected by 
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The cellular uptake 
efficiency of nanoparticles by A549 cells was observed by fluorescence 
microscope. Antitumor effects of nanoparticles were assessed in the nude mouse 
model of SM.
RESULTS: The genomic amplification of ANXA9 was prevalent in LUAD tissues and 
closely associated with poor outcome and SM (P<0.01). The experimental result 
manifested that high expression of ANXA9 could lead to wretched prognosis and 
ANXA9 was an independent risk factor for survival (P<0.05). After impeding 
expression of ANXA9, the proliferation and metastatic ability of tumor cells 
obviously decreased, and expression of matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2) and 
matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) were considerably downregulated, while the 
expression of associated oncogene pathway were downregulated (P<0.01) as well. 
The synthesized HM-loaded NPS nano-composites could target to cancer and 
response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) to release HM slowly. Notably, in 
comparison to free HM, the nano-composites showed excellent targeting and 
anti-tumor effects in the A549 cell-bearing mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: ANXA9 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting poor prognosis 
in LUAD, and we provided an efficient and targeting drug delivery 
nano-composites system for precise treatment of SM from LUAD.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-23-191

mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited. Our objective was to 
evaluate the impact of pathogenic BRCA variants detected by tumour 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) on disease course and response to therapy.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all consecutive NSCLC patients 
with available NGS reports in a single institution between 01/2015 and 08/2020. 
Pathogenicity of identified mutations was determined according to American 
College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines. Log rank and cox regression 
analyses were used to determine the association between BRCA mutation status, 
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) under various 
front-line treatment modalities for advanced disease.
RESULTS: Out of 445 patients with NGS data (54% tissue, 46% liquid), 109 (24.5%) 
patients had a documented BRCA variant; 5.6% (25/445) had a pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic variant (pBRCA). Forty percent (10/25) of pBRCA patients had no 
co-occurring NSCLC driver mutations. Patients with pBRCA NSCLC had a less 
prominent smoking history [mean 42.6 (29.2) vs. 25.7 (24.0) pack years; 
P=0.024]. Median PFS with first-line chemo-immunotherapy was significantly 
prolonged for pBRCA patients (n=7) compared with wild-type BRCA (wtBRCA) 
patients (n=30) (HR =0.279; P=0.021, 95% CI: 0.094-0.825).
CONCLUSIONS: pBRCA-mutated NSCLC can represent a specific subtype of pulmonary 
carcinoma. Patients whose tumours harbor pBRCA mutations present with a less 
prominent smoking history and exhibit prolonged PFS with chemo-immunotherapy 
combinations compared with wtBRCA controls. In a subset of these patients, pBRCA 
is the sole identifiable putative driver mutation, hinting at a significant role 
for BRCA loss in oncogenesis.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-22-594

the United States (U.S.), with non-White people who smoke often bearing the 
burden of the highest rate of LC mortality. This is often due to later stage 
diagnoses, leading to poor prognosis and outcomes. We assess here how the 
eligibility criteria for LC screening set by the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
Force (USPSTF) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) could 
contribute to racial disparities in screening access.
METHODS: This paper analyzes data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES), an annual survey conducted by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that gathers health and nutrition data from 
a representative sample of the U.S. population. After excluding those who were 
ineligible for LC screening, the final cohort of participants was 5,001, which 
consisted of 2,669 people who formerly smoked and 2,332 people who currently 
smoke.
RESULTS: Out of 608 participants who were eligible for LC screening, 77.5% were 
non-Hispanic White (NHW) and 8.7% were non-Hispanic Black (NHB) participants 
versus 69.4% and 10.8% among 4,393 ineligible participants. Age, pack-years, and 
age along with pack-years were the most frequent reasons for ineligibility. LC 
screening ineligible NHW participants were statistically significantly older and 
had higher mean pack-years than the other racial and ethnic groups. NHB 
participants among the ineligible group had higher urinary cotinine levels 
compared to NHW participants.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper underscores the need for more individualized risk 
estimates when determining eligibility for LC screening, which could include 
biomarkers of smoking exposure. The analysis shows that current screening 
criteria, which rely solely on factors such as age and pack years, contribute to 
LC racial disparities.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-22-816

1 (PD-1/PD-L1) antibodies have been shown to improve overall and 
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all patients derive a 
meaningful clinical benefit. Additionally, patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
therapy can experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Clinically 
significant irAEs may require temporary pause or discontinuation of treatment. 
Having a tool to identify patients who may not benefit and/or are at risk for 
developing severe irAEs from immunotherapy will aid in an informed 
decision-making process for the patients and their physicians.
METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) scans and clinical data were retrospectively 
collected for this study to develop three prediction models using (I) radiomic 
features, (II) clinical features, and (III) radiomic and clinical features 
combined. Each subject had 6 clinical features and 849 radiomic features 
extracted. Selected features were run through an artificial neural network (NN) 
trained on 70% of the cohort, maintaining the case and control ratio. The NN was 
assessed by calculating the area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic 
curve (AUC-ROC), area-under-the-precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), sensitivity, 
and specificity.
RESULTS: A cohort of 132 subjects, of which 43 (33%) had a PFS ≤90 days and 89 
(67%) of which had a PFS >90 days was used to develop the prediction models. The 
radiomic model was able to predict progression-free survival with a training 
AUC-ROC of 87% and testing AUC-ROC, sensitivity, and specificity of 83%, 75%, 
and 81%, respectively. In this cohort, the clinical and radiomic combined 
features did add a slight increase in the specificity (85%) but with a decrease 
in sensitivity (75%) and AUC-ROC (81%).

that would see a benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-22-763

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most common human malignant tumors and the 
leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Biphenyl hydrolase-like (BPHL) is a 
gene encoding the human BPHL enzyme, a serine hydrolase that catalyzes the 
hydrolytic activation of amino acid ester prodrugs of nucleoside analogs such as 
valacyclovir and valganciclovir. However, the role of BPHL in lung cancer is 
still unknown.
METHODS: In this study, we assessed the effect BPHL knockdown on the 
proliferation, apoptosis, colony formation, metastasis, and cell cycle of cancer 
cells. BPHL knockdown NCI-H1299 and A549 cells demonstrated decreased 
proliferation, as measured by Celigo cell counting. The MTT assay results were 
consistent with Celigo cell counting. Caspase 3/7 activity increased 
significantly in the NCI-H1299 and A549 cells after shBPHL knockdown. Decreased 
colony formation in the NCI-H1299 and A54 cells after shBPHL knockdown, as 
measured by crystal violet staining. Transmigration assay using a Transwell 
demonstrated that there were significantly fewer migrating cells in the lower 
chamber in the BPHL knockdown NCI-H1299 and A549 cells. Cell cycle analysis by 
Propidium Iodide (PI) staining and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). We 
also explored the effect of BPHL knockdown on tumor growth in a mouse model of 
tumor implantation in nude mice.
RESULTS: We found that the knockdown of BPHL gene expression by short hairpin 
RNA (shRNA) leads to a decrease in proliferation, colony formation, and 
metastasis and an increase in apoptosis in two lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell 
lines in vitro. BPHL knockdown induces decreased tumor growth, colony formation, 
and metastasis; increased apoptosis; and altered cell cycle destruction. BPHL 
knockdown results in decreased tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, BPHL knockdown 
A549 cells demonstrated slower growth compared to control cells upon 
implantation in nude mice, confirming the in vitro findings.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the data indicate that BPHL potentially promotes 
proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and increases colony formation and metastasis 
in lung cancer. Overall, our study suggests that BPHL may be a gene that 
promotes tumor growth in lung cancer.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-23-225

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Tumor local and distant relapse recurrence after radiotherapy (RT) 
is one of the critical factors leading to poor prognosis. The effective 
antitumor effects of RT are dependent upon the participation of innate and 
adaptive components of the immune system. C5a/C5aR1 signaling can regulate 
antitumor immune effect in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, exploring the 
changes and mechanism in the TME induced by RT-mediated complement activation 
may provide a novel perspective for reversing radioresistance.
METHODS: First, fractionated radiation of 8 Gy ×3 fractions were targeted at 
Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor-bearing female mice to measure the infiltration 
of CD8+ T cell and analyze the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in RT-recruited CD8+ T 
cells. Second, tumor growth was measured in LLC tumor-bearing mice treated with 
RT either with or without C5aR1 inhibitor to clarify the antitumor effect of RT 
combined with C5aR1 inhibitor. Third, we detected the expression of C5a/C5aR1 
and their signaling pathways on radiated tumor tissues. Furthermore, we 
investigated the expression of C5a in tumor cells at different time points after 
different doses of RT.
RESULTS: In our system, RT induced the increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells 
and local activation of complement C5a/C5aR. Concurrent administration of RT and 
blocking of C5aR improved radiosensitivity and tumor-specific immune response, 
which was reflected by high C5aR expression in CD8+ T cells. The AKT/NF-κB 
pathway was found to be an important signaling pathway in C5a/C5aR axis 
mediation by RT.
CONCLUSIONS: RT promotes the release of C5a from tumor cells and leads to 
up-regulation of C5aR1 expression via the AKT/NF-κB pathway. Inhibition of the 
combination of complement C5a and C5aR could improve RT sensitivity. Our work 
provides evidence that the combination of RT and C5aR blockade opens a new 
window of opportunity to promote anti-tumor therapeutic effects in lung cancer.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-23-258

increased over the past decade. There is a need to investigate whether women's 
participation in academia, as reflected by publication activity, increased over 
the time. This study aimed to investigate trends in female authorship in top 
journals of lung cancer in the past ten years.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of all original research and review 
articles published in lung cancer journals including New England Journal of 
Medicine, Lancet journals, JAMA journals, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Annals 
of Oncology, Cancer Discovery, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, and Translational 
Lung Cancer Research (TLCR) between 2012 and 2021, the sex composition of lead 
authors were analyzed. The sex of the author was confirmed by internet searching 
for photographs, biographies, and gender-specific pronouns from journal or 
personal websites. The time-trend of female authorship was determined using 
Join-Point Regression (JPR) analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 3,625 first authors and 3,612 corresponding authors were 
identified in the journals during the years studied. The sex of the author was 
revealed for 98.5%. Among 3,625 first authors with the sex being revealed, 1,224 
(33.7%) were women. The proportion of female first authors increased remarkably 
from 29.4% in 2012 to 39.8% in 2021. The annual percentage change (APC) in 
female first authorship took place in 2019 [APC for 2019-2021, 37.03, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 18.0-59.1, P=0.003]. The proportion of first authors 
in TLCR increased from 25.9% in 2012 to 42.8% in 2021 and showed the greatest 
rise in female first authorship. There were significant discrepancies in the 
female first authorship across the journals and regions. Among the 3,612 
corresponding authors whose sex were determined, 884 (24.5%) were female. There 
is no significant increasing trend in female corresponding authorship.
CONCLUSIONS: The sex gap in the first authorship of lung cancer research 
articles has improved markedly in the recent years, however, sex imparities 
persist especially in corresponding authorship. There is an urgent need to 
proactively support and promote women in taking the leadership roles, thereby 
increasing their contributions to and influence on the development or

scans, including the tumor dimensions, presence of ground-glass opacity (GGO), 
margin characteristics, tumor location, and deep learning-based features. Tumor 
dimensions include diameter and volume, which are among the most potent 
prognostic factors in lung cancer. In lung adenocarcinomas, the solid component 
size on CT scans as well as the total tumor size is associated with the 
prognosis. The areas of GGO indicate the lepidic component and are associated 
with better postoperative survival in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas. As for 
the margin characteristics, which represent the CT manifestation of fibrotic 
stroma or desmoplasia, tumor spiculation should be evaluated. The tumor location 
in the central lung is associated with occult nodal metastasis and is a worse 
prognostic factor per se. Last but not least, deep learning analysis enables 
prognostic feature extraction beyond the human eyes.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-22-904

with advanced, treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Combining 
antiangiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can counteract the 
immunosuppression and confer synergistic therapeutic benefits. We explored the 
efficacy and safety of anlotinib and ICIs as a second- and subsequent-line 
treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in patients without oncogenic 
driver alterations.
METHODS: We reviewed patients with driver-negative LUAD who had received 
anlotinib, a multityrosine kinase inhibitor affecting vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit, in combination with 
ICIs from October 2018 to July 2021 at Shanghai Chest Hospital as second- and 
subsequent-line treatment. Patients with advanced driver-negative LUAD who 
received nivolumab monotherapy as second-line treatment were included as a 
control group.
RESULTS: In this study, 71 patients were included who had received anlotinib and 
programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade combination therapy as second- and 
subsequent-line treatment, and 63 patients who had received nivolumab 
monotherapy as second-line therapy were included as controls, most of whom were 
male smokers at stage IV. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of the 
combination therapy and nivolumab monotherapy groups were 6.00 and 3.41 months, 
respectively (P<0.001). The median overall survival (OS) of the combination 
therapy and nivolumab monotherapy groups were 16.13 and 11.88 months, 
respectively (P=0.046). Twenty-nine patients (40.8%) in the combination group 
underwent previous immunotherapy (15 of whom were in first line), and they also 
achieved good survival (median OS: 25.67 months). The adverse reactions in the 
combination therapy group were mainly associated with either anlotinib or ICI 
administration, and there was a low incidence of grade 3 adverse events, all of 
which were resolved after intervention or discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the multitargeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
anlotinib and PD-1 blockade demonstrated significant benefits as the second- and

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
yields highest expectations for recovery. However, the frequency of further 
disease progression remains high since micro-metastatic disease may be 
undetected by conventional diagnostic methods. We test the presence and 
prognostic impact of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood (PB), 
tumor-draining pulmonary blood (TDB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from NSCLC 
patients.
METHODS: The presence of circulating/disseminated tumor cells (CTCs/DTCs) was 
detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) analysis in PB, TDB and BM samples before surgery in 119 stage IA-IIIA 
NSCLC patients (Clinical Trial NS10285).
RESULTS: NSCLC patients with the presence of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 
mRNA-positive CTCs/DTCs in TDB and BM had significantly shorter cancer-specific 
survival (CSS) (P<0.013, resp. P<0.038). Patients with the presence of 
epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM) mRNA-positive CTCs in TDB samples 
had significantly shorter CSS and disease-free survival (DFS) (P<0.031, resp. 
P<0.045). A multivariate analysis identified the presence of CEA mRNA-positive 
CTCs in the PB as an independent negative prognostic factor for DFS (P<0.005). 
No significant correlation of CTCs/DTCs presence and other prognostic factors 
was found.
CONCLUSIONS: In NSCLC patients undergoing radical surgery, the presence of CEA 
and EpCAM mRNA-positive CTCs/DTCs is associated with poorer survival.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-22-801

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological type of 
lung cancer, of which genomic alterations play a major role in tumorigenesis. 
The prognosis of LUAD has been improved these years but nearly half of the 
patients still develop recurrence even after radical resection. The underlying 
mechanism driving LUAD recurrence especially genomic alterations is complicated 
and worth exploring.
METHODS: Forty-one primary tumors and 43 recurrent tumors were collected from 41 
LUAD patients who received surgery resection after recurrence. Whole exon 
sequencing (WES) was performed to make genomic landscapes. WES data were aligned 
to genome and further analyzed for somatic mutation, copy number variation and 
structure variation. MutsigCV was used to identify significantly mutated genes 
and recurrence specific genes.
RESULTS: Significantly mutated genes including EGFR, MUC4 and TP53 were 
identified in primary and recurrent tumors. Some were found to be more 
specifically mutated in recurrent tumors, such as the MUC17, KRAS and ZNF 
families. In recurrent tumors, ErbB signaling pathway, MAPK pathway and cell 
cycle pathway were highly activated, which maybe the mechanism driving 
recurrence. The adjuvant therapy would affect tumor evolution and molecular 
features during recurrence. MUC4 was highly mutated in this study cohort, and it 
was a potential driver gene in LUAD recurrence by activating ErbB signaling 
pathway as a ligand of ERBB2.
CONCLUSIONS: Genomic alteration landscape was changing during LUAD recurrence to 
construct a more suitable environment for the survival of tumor cells. Several 
potential driver mutations and targets during LUAD recurrence were identified, 
such as MUC4, and more investigation was needed to verify the specific functions 
and roles.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-22-793

dose-limiting due to treatment-related toxicities. Genistein has been shown to 
be a robust radioprotective agent in preclinical models. A novel genistein oral 
nanosuspension formulation (nano-genistein) has demonstrated efficacy in 
mitigating radiation-induced lung damage in preclinical animal models. However, 
while those studies have confirmed that nano-genistein can protect normal lung 
tissue from radiation-induced toxicities, no studies have assessed the effect of 
nano-genistein on lung tumors. Here, we evaluated the impact of nano-genistein 
on the efficacy of radiation treatment of lung tumors in a mouse xenograft 
model.
METHODS: Two separate studies were conducted utilizing human A549 cells 
implanted either dorsally within the upper torso or in the flank. Daily oral 
administration of nano-genistein (200 or 400 mg/kg/day) occurred prior to and 
after exposure to a single dose of thoracic or abdominal 12.5 Gy radiation. 
Tumor growth was monitored twice weekly, nano-genistein treatment continued for 
up to 20 weeks and histopathology of tissues was completed post euthanasia.
RESULTS: Continuous nano-genistein dosing was safe across all study groups in 
both studies. Animals receiving nano-genistein better maintained body weight 
following irradiation compared to corresponding vehicle treated animals. Animals 
that received nano-genistein also had reduced tumor growth and improved normal 
lung histopathology compared to those receiving vehicle suggesting that 
nano-genistein does not protect tumors from radiotherapy but is radioprotective 
of the lungs. There were no treatment-related histopathological findings noted 
in the skin adjacent to the tumor, esophagus, or uterus.
CONCLUSIONS: These results, including the safety following extended dosing, 
support the continued evaluation of nano-genistein as an adjunctive treatment 
for patients with NSCLC undergoing radiotherapy and serve as the basis of a

protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) has provided new hope for patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, good biomarkers are needed to 
identify which patients will benefit from the treatment. In this study, we 
investigated if circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) could predict response to 
pembrolizumab.
METHODS: Plasma samples from patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab were 
collected immediately before and after one or two cycles of treatment. ctDNA was 
isolated and analyzed using targeted next-generation sequencing with a lung 
cancer gene panel.
RESULTS: Mutations were detected in ctDNA in 83.93% of patients before treatment 
initiation. High blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB), measured as the number of 
different mutations per Mb panel, correlated to longer progression-free survival 
(PFS) (10.45 vs. 2.30 months) and overall survival (OS) (21.80 vs. 12.20 
months), whereas no predictive value was found in the number of mutant molecules 
per mL of plasma. The absence of mutations just after treatment initiation 
correlated with improved PFS (20.25 vs. 4.18 months) and OS (28.93 vs. 15.33 
months). High bTMB before treatment was associated with a decreasing ctDNA level 
after treatment initiation. Importantly, a subgroup of patients experienced an 
increase in the ctDNA level after treatment initiation, and this correlated with 
inferior PFS (2.19 vs. 11.21 months) and OS (7.76 vs. 24.20 months). All 
patients in the subgroup with increased ctDNA level progressed within 10 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of ctDNA contains vital information about response to 
therapy, where the bTMB and the dynamics in the initial part of treatment are 
particularly important for response. Increasing ctDNA levels after treatment 
initiation are significantly correlated with inferior survival.",2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/tlcr-22-818

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the presence of a 
radiographically manifested ground-glass opacity (GGO) component on the 
prognosis of patients with pathological stage IA3 lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with pathological stage IA3 lung adenocarcinoma who 
underwent radical surgery at two medical institutions in China between July 2012 
and July 2020 were enrolled. The cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) and 
cumulative incidence of death (CID) in patients with and without a GGO component 
were compared. Risk curves for the recurrence and tumor-related death overtime 
were analyzed between the two groups according to life table. In order to 
validate the prognostic value of GGO components, the recurrence-free survival 
(RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were estimated. Decision curve analysis 
(DCA) was performed to evaluate the clinical benefit rate of different models.
RESULTS: Among the 352 included patients, the presence of a GGO component was 
radiographically shown in 166 (47.2%) patients, while 186 (52.8%) displayed 
solid nodules. Patients exhibiting the absence of a GGO component had higher 
incidences of total recurrence (17.2% vs. 3.0%, P<0.001), local-regional 
recurrence (LRR) (5.4% vs. 0.6%, P=0.010), distant metastasis (DM) (8.1% vs. 
1.8%, P=0.008), and multiple recurrences (4.3% vs. 0.6%, P=0.028) than the 
presence-GGO component group. The 5-year CIR and CID were 7.5% and 7.4% in the 
presence-GGO component group, and 24.5% and 17.0% in the absence-GGO component 
group, respectively, with statistically significant differences between the two 
groups (P<0.05). The risk of recurrence in patients with the presence of GGO 
components showed a single peak at 3 years postoperatively, while patients with 
the absence of GGO components showed a double peak at 1 and 5 years after 
surgery, respectively. However, the risk of tumor-related death peaked in both 
groups at 3 and 6 years postoperatively. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that 
the presence of a GGO component was a favorable independent risk factor for 
pathological stage IA3 lung adenocarcinoma patients (P<0.05).

Vasant Kunj Rd, New Delhi 110070, India.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), once considered a benign condition, 
has been associated with several cardiometabolic complications over the past two 
decades. The worldwide prevalence of NAFLD is as high as 30%. NAFLD requires the 
absence of a ""significant alcohol intake."" Conflicting reports have suggested 
that moderate alcohol consumption may be protective; therefore, the diagnosis of 
NAFLD previously relied on negative criteria. However, there has been a 
significant increase in alcohol consumption globally. Apart from the rise in 
alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), alcohol, a major toxin, is associated with 
an increased risk of several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Alcohol misuse is a significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years. 
Recently, the term metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) 
was proposed instead of NAFLD to include the metabolic dysfunction responsible 
for the major adverse outcomes in patients with fatty liver disease. MAFLD, 
dependent on the ""positive diagnostic criteria"" rather than previous exclusion 
criteria, may identify individuals with poor metabolic health and aid in 
managing patients at increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
Although MAFLD is less stigmatizing than NAFLD, excluding alcohol intake may 
increase the risk of already existing underreported alcohol consumption in this 
subgroup of patients. Therefore, alcohol consumption may increase the prevalence 
of fatty liver disease and its associated complications in patients with MAFLD. 
This review discusses the effects of alcohol intake and MAFLD on fatty liver 
disease.","© The Author(s), 2023.","DOI: 10.1177/20420188231178370

combination therapy is broadly applied in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients. However, meta-analysis about safety and efficacy of RT + ICB versus 
ICB has not yet been reported. To evaluate safety and efficacy of the 
combination therapy of ICB and RT in patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC 
and explore factors related to higher response rates, longer lifetime, and lower 
toxicity, meta-analysis of previous clinical data will be presented in this 
article.
METHODS: A literature search on patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC 
treated with RT + ICB versus ICB was performed using the Cochrane Library, 
Embase and PubMed up to December 10, 2022. Suitable quality assessment 
checklists were selected corresponding to various types of research studies. 
Comparative and single-arm studies were analyzed using Stata 14.0.
RESULTS: 10 comparative studies and 15 arms of combination therapy were included 
for this meta-analysis. RT significantly improved objective response rate (ORR), 
disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS) of ICB (I-square value (I2 ) = 0.00%, odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.49, I2  = 0.00%, OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.25, I2 
 = 42.1%, OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72-0.92, I2  = 34.5%, OR 0.80, and 95% CI 0.71-0.89, 
respectively). Toxicity between combination therapy and ICB monotherapy did not 
significantly differ in any grade or in ≥3 grade of tr-AEs (I2  = 0.00%, OR 
1.05, 95% CI 0.91-1.22, I2  = 0.00%, OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.90-2.37, respectively). 
Subgroup analyses based on single-arm studies showed that applications of 
SRS/SBRT, PD-1 inhibitor, and administration of ICB after RT were conducive to a 
better DCR, longer OS and mild adverse events (heterogeneity between groups 
(HBG) all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: RT can significantly improve ORR, DCR, OS, and PFS of ICB in 
patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC without increasing toxicity. PD-1 
inhibitor following SRS/SBRT could be the best option to maximally benefit the 
patients.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.5958

emergence of various therapeutic modalities with excellent therapeutic 
efficiency and biosafety, among which, the sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a 
combination of low-intensity ultrasound and sonosensitizers, is emerging as a 
promising noninvasive treatment modality for cancer treatment due to its deeper 
penetration, good patient compliance, and minimal damage to normal tissue. The 
sonosensitizers are indispensable components in the SDT process because their 
structure and physicochemical properties are decisive for therapeutic efficacy. 
Compared to the conventional and mostly studied organic sonosensitizers, 
inorganic sonosensitizers (noble metal-based, transition metal-based, 
carbon-based, and silicon-based sonosensitizers) display excellent stability, 
controllable morphology, and multifunctionality, which greatly expand their 
application in SDT. In this review, the possible mechanisms of SDT including the 
cavitation effect and reactive oxygen species generation are briefly discussed. 
Then, the recent advances in inorganic sonosensitizers are systematically 
summarized and their formulations and antitumor effects, particularly 
highlighting the strategies for optimizing the therapeutic efficiency, are 
outlined. The challenges and future perspectives for developing state-of-the-art

breast cancer growth and progression. We proved that adiponectin promotes 
proliferation in ERα-positive breast cancer cells, through ERα transactivation 
and the recruitment of LKB1 as ERα-coactivator. Here, we showed that 
adiponectin-mediated ERα transactivation enhances E-cadherin expression. Thus, 
we investigated the molecular mechanism through which ERα/LKB1 complex may 
modulate the expression of E-cadherin, influencing tumor growth, progression and 
distant metastasis. We demonstrated that adiponectin increases E-cadherin 
expression in ERα-positive 2D and higher extent in 3D cultures. This occurs 
through a direct activation of E-cadherin gene promoter by ERα/LKB1-complex. The 
impact of E-cadherin on ERα-positive breast cancer cell proliferation comes from 
the evidence that in the presence of E-cadherin siRNA the proliferative effects 
of adiponectin is no longer noticeable. Since E-cadherin connects cell polarity 
and growth, we investigated if the adiponectin-enhanced E-cadherin expression 
could influence the localization of proteins cooperating in cell polarity, such 
as LKB1 and Cdc42. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence showed that, in 
adiponectin-treated MCF-7 cells, LKB1 and Cdc42 mostly colocalize in the 
nucleus, impairing their cytosolic cooperation in maintaining cell polarity. The 
orthotopic implantation of MCF-7 cells revealed an enhanced E-cadherin-mediated 
breast cancer growth induced by adiponectin. Moreover, tail vein injection of 
MCF-7 cells showed a higher metastatic burden in the lungs of mice receiving 
adiponectin-treated cells compared to control. From these findings it emerges 
that adiponectin treatment enhances E-cadherin expression, alters cell polarity 
and stimulates ERα-positive breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, 
sustaining higher distant metastatic burden.","© 2023 The Authors. International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley &

but its use can be accompanied by unusual side effects.
CASE REPORT: We describe herein a 74-year-old patient with pancreatic cancer who 
developed severe motor weakness affecting lower extremities after starting 
treatment with oxaliplatin on three separate occasions. Our patient also 
experienced slurred speech, with decreased ability to phonate and word-finding 
difficulty. Brain imaging studies did not suggest recent brain ischemia, and the 
symptoms resolved within 15-20 h.
MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Oxaliplatin had to be discontinued due to suboptimal 
tolerance and a short-lived clinical response. After discontinuation of 
oxaliplatin, she did not experience any more similar symptoms. A score of 9 on 
the Naranjo nomogram supported a definite causality relationship between 
oxaliplatin and the observed neurologic toxicity.
DISCUSSION: Rare reports of stroke-like events have previously been described 
with oxaliplatin. While the exact mechanism of these phenomena is not known, 
alterations in neuronal sodium channels might be involved. Clinicians, 
pharmacists, and patients need to be aware of these rare but important side 
effects of oxaliplatin. Nonetheless, work-up for a cerebrovascular accident is 
still warranted as hypercoagulability related to malignancy can also predispose 
the patients to strokes.","DOI: 10.1177/10781552231181525

health and HER2 positivity for approximately 15-20$ \% $ invasive breast cancer 
cases. Follow-up data for HER2-positive patients are rare, and research on 
prognosis and auxiliary diagnosis is still limited. In light of the findings 
obtained from the analysis of clinical features, we have developed a novel 
multiple instance learning (MIL) fusion model that integrates hematoxylin-eosin 
(HE) pathological images and clinical features to accurately predict the 
prognostic risk of patients. Specifically, we segmented the HE pathology images 
of patients into patches, clustered them by K-means, aggregated them into a bag 
feature-level representation through graph attention networks (GATs) and 
multihead attention networks, and fused them with clinical features to predict 
the prognosis of patients. We divided West China Hospital (WCH) patients (n = 
1069) into a training cohort and internal validation cohort and used The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients (n = 160) as an external test cohort. The 3-fold 
average C-index of the proposed OS-based model was 0.668, the C-index of the WCH 
test set was 0.765, and the C-index of the TCGA independent test set was 0.726. 
By plotting the Kaplan-Meier curve, the fusion feature (P = 0.034) model 
distinguished high- and low-risk groups more accurately than clinical features 
(P = 0.19). The MIL model can directly analyze a large number of unlabeled 
pathological images, and the multimodal model is more accurate than the unimodal 
models in predicting Her2-positive breast cancer prognosis based on large 
amounts of data.","DOI: 10.3934/mbe.2023496

is highly interesting due to its increasing incidence. Many studies have shown 
that the basement membrane (BM) plays an important role in the development of 
cancer, and structural and functional changes in the BM can be observed in most 
renal lesions. However, the role of BM in the malignant progression of PRCC and 
its impact on prognosis has not been fully studied. Therefore, this study aimed 
to explore the functional and prognostic value of basement membrane-associated 
genes (BMs) in PRCC patients. We identified differentially expressed BMs between 
PRCC tumor samples and normal tissue and systematically explored the relevance 
of BMs to immune infiltration. Moreover, we constructed a risk signature based 
on these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Lasso regression analysis 
and demonstrated their independence using Cox regression analysis. Finally, we 
predicted 9 small molecule drugs with the potential to treat PRCC and compared 
the differences in sensitivity to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents between 
high and low-risk groups to better target patients for more precise treatment 
planning. Taken together, our study suggested that BMs might play a crucial role 
in the development of PRCC, and these results might provide new insights into 
the treatment of PRCC.","DOI: 10.3934/mbe.2023474

cascade plays an essential role in tumor disease progression and leads to death 
in LUAD. We differentiated two coagulation-related subtypes in LUAD patients in 
this study based on coagulation pathways collected from the KEGG database. We 
then demonstrated significant differences between the two coagulation-associated 
subtypes regarding immune characteristics and prognostic stratification. For 
risk stratification and prognostic prediction, we developed a 
coagulation-related risk score prognostic model in the Cancer Genome Atlas

coagulation-related risk score in terms of prognosis and immunotherapy. Based on 
these results, we identified coagulation-related prognostic factors in LUAD, 
which may serve as a robust prognostic biomarker for therapeutic and 
immunotherapeutic efficacy. It may contribute to clinical decision-making in

(EC) have been correlated significantly with redox. We aimed to develop and 
validate a redox-related prognostic model of patients with EC to predict the 
prognosis and the efficacy of immunotherapy. We downloaded gene expression 
profiles and clinical information of patients with EC from the Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Ontology (GO) dataset. We identified two key 
differentially expressed redox genes (CYBA and SMPD3) by univariate Cox 
regression and utilised them to calculate the risk score of all samples. Based 
on the median of risk scores, we composed low-and high-risk groups and performed 
correlation analysis with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints. 
Finally, we constructed a nomogram of the prognostic model based on clinical 
factors and the risk score. We verified the predictive performance using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves. CYBA and SMPD3 
were significantly related to the prognosis of patients with EC and used to 
construct a risk model. There were significant differences in survival, immune 
cell infiltration and immune checkpoints between the low-and high-risk groups. 
The nomogram developed with clinical indicators and the risk scores was 
effective in predicting the prognosis of patients with EC. In this study, a 
prognostic model constructed based on two redox-related genes (CYBA and SMPD3) 
were proved to be independent prognostic factors of EC and associated with 
tumour immune microenvironment. The redox signature genes have the potential to 
predict the prognosis and the immunotherapy efficacy of patients with EC.","DOI: 10.3934/mbe.2023453

subtyping based on the gene expression profiles is an effective technique for 
diagnosing and determining the prognosis of NSCLC patients.
METHODS: Here, we downloaded the NSCLC expression profiles from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus databases. ConsensusClusterPlus was 
used to derive the molecular subtypes based on long-chain noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
associated with the PD-1-related pathway. The LIMMA package and least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox analysis were used to construct the 
prognostic risk model. The nomogram was constructed to predict the clinical 
outcomes, followed by decision curve analysis (DCA) to validate the reliability 
of this nomogram.
RESULTS: We discovered that PD-1 was strongly and positively linked to the 
T-cell receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, we identified two NSCLC 
molecular subtypes yielding a significantly distinctive prognosis. Subsequently, 
we developed and validated the 13-lncRNA-based prognostic risk model in the four 
datasets with high AUC values. Patients with low-risk showed a better survival 
rate and were more sensitive to PD-1 treatment. Nomogram construction combined 
with DCA revealed that the risk score model could accurately predict the 
prognosis of NSCLC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that lncRNAs engaged in the T-cell receptor 
signaling pathway played a significant role in the onset and development of 
NSCLC, and that they could influence the sensitivity to PD-1 treatment. In 
addition, the 13 lncRNA model was effective in assisting clinical treatment 
decision-making and prognosis evaluation.","DOI: 10.3934/mbe.2023430

METHODS: Databases were searched to September 2021. Primary outcomes were 
serious and high-grade infection. Relative-risk (RR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (95%CI) were calculated using random-effects models.
RESULTS: IPD meta-analysis (6 RCTs, 2971 participants, 2320 infections) 
demonstrated higher infection incidence with subcutaneous versus intravenous 
administration, without reaching statistical significance (serious: 12.2% versus 
9.3%, RR 1.28, 95%CI 0.93to1.77, P = 0.13; high-grade: 12.2% versus 9.9%, RR 
1.32, 95%CI 0.98to1.77, P = 0.07). With exclusion of an outlying study in 
post-hoc analysis, increased risks were statistically significant (serious: 
13.1% versus 8.4%, RR 1.53, 95%CI 1.14to2.06, P = 0.01; high-grade: 13.2% versus 
9.3%, RR 1.56, 95%CI 1.16to2.11, P < 0.01). Published data meta-analysis (8

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest increased infection risk with subcutaneous versus 
intravenous administration, although IPD findings are sensitive to exclusion of 
one trial with inconsistent results and identified risk-of-bias. Ongoing trials 
may confirm findings. Clinical surveillance should be considered when switching 
to subcutaneous administration. PROSPERO registration

conventional SPR sensors face the challenge of lower sensitivity and selectivity 
for trace exosomes assay in complex serum. We proposed a core-shell Au@SiO2-Au 
film (Au@SiO2-Au film) metasurface to enhance SPR signal based on systematic 
study on the relationship between gap modes and SPR enhancement. The 
self-assembled multifunctional peptide was designed as recognition layer with 
antifouling properties for ultrasensitive and selective detection of PD-L1+ 
exosomes in serum. The tuning electromagnetic (EM) field model by manipulating 
the gap was established to guide the preparation of Au@SiO2-Au film metasurface. 
The in-plane and out-of-plane coupling of Au@SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) could 
greatly enlarge and enhance three-dimensional EM field to meet the size of 
exosomes located in the evanescent field. At the structural level, we achieved 
high sensitivity (0.16 particles/mL) and a broad response range (10-5 × 103 
particles/mL) through optimizing the thickness of SiO2 and surface coverage of 
Au@SiO2. Furthermore, clinical sample assay achieved the optimal diagnostic 
accuracy (AUC = 0.97) for differentiating cancer patients from healthy controls. 
This work provides an opportunity for the construction of a tunable gap mode as 
SPR enhancer in a total internal reflection architecture. The systematic study 
on the relationship between gap modes and SPR sensitivity provides a broad scope 
for promoting direct, efficient, highly selective, and sensitive detection of 
SPR sensors for clinical application.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01451

retrospective cohort study was conducted between March 1, 2020, and July 31, 
2021. Patients who received doxycycline in intensive care units (ICUs) were 
compared to patients who did not (control). The primary outcome was the 
composite thrombotic events. The secondary outcomes were 30-day and in-hospital 
mortality, length of stay, ventilator-free days, and complications during ICU 
stay. Propensity score (PS) matching was used based on the selected criteria. 
Logistic, negative binomial, and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses 
were used as appropriate. After PS (1:3) matching, 664 patients (doxycycline n = 
166, control n = 498) were included. The number of thromboembolic events was 
lower in the doxycycline group (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.26-1.08; P = .08); however, 
it failed to reach to a statistical significance. Moreover, D-dimer levels and 
30-day mortality were lower in the doxycycline group (beta coefficient [95% CI]: 
-0.22 [-0.46, 0.03; P = .08]; HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.52-1.00; P = .05,

located at the boundary of the distal esophagus and gastric cardia, and surgical 
resection is currently performed using open or laparoscopic methods. This report 
presents 2 cases of laparoscopic resection of Siewert type II adenocarcinoma of 
the esophagogastric junction using a transhiatal approach, complicated by 
hemopericardium. CASE REPORT We present 2 patients diagnosed with Siewert type 
II esophagogastric junction cancer. A 67-year-old man had intermittent dull pain 
in the epigastrium without apparent cause for 10 months. A 69-year-old man had 
persistent dull pain in the middle and upper abdomen for more than 3 months and 
acid reflux after eating. Gastroscopy with pathological examination confirmed 
the diagnoses. The patients underwent laparoscopic transhiatal total gastrectomy 
according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines 2018 (5th 
edition). Pathological analysis classified the cancers as T3N1M0 and T2N0M0, 
respectively. The patients' cases were complicated with hemopericardium 18 h and 
23 h after surgery, respectively. The shared clinical symptoms of the patients 
included tachycardia and low blood pressure. Cardiovascular color Doppler 
ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) were used to identify the 
hemopericardium. Following emergent ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis and 
drainage, the vital signs of the patients improved. Both patients recovered 
well, and no other complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS Hemopericardium is a 
life-threatening complication for patients with esophageal-gastric junction 
cancer who undergo transhiatal laparoscopic surgery. Quick detection and 
intervention for postoperative hemopericardium following laparoscopic 
transhiatal total gastrectomy are important. Ultrasound-guided 
pericardiocentesis and drainage is effective for the treatment of postoperative 
hemopericardium.","DOI: 10.12659/AJCR.939376

RESULTS: The mean age at first diagnosis of melanoma was 44.8 years 
(SD ± 17.83). Most patients had phototype II (44.9%), more than 50 melanocytic 
nevi (76.8%), atypical nevus syndrome (72.5%), history of sunburn (76.8%), and 
multiple primary melanomas without a family history of this tumor (74.3%). Two 
hundred melanomas were observed. Most tumors had a Breslow index ≤1.0 mm 
(84.5%), location in the trunk (60.5%), and superficial spreading histological 
subtype (22.5%). Four variants were found in CDKN2A exons in seven patients 
(c.305C>A, c.26T>A, c.361G>A e c.442G>A), two variants in the 5'UTR region in 
five patients (c.-25C>T and c.-33G>C), and two variants in the 3'UTR region in 
21 patients (c.*29C>G and c.*69C>T). One likely pathogenic variant (c.305C>A) 
was identified in one patient (1.4%). No variant was found in CDK4.

cells, which elicit immune responses, potentially resulting in tumor regression. 
Tumor cell death induced by chemotherapy has also been reported to activate 
immunity. However, various studies have reported drug-induced immunosuppression 
or suppression of inflammation by apoptotic cells. Thus, this study aimed to 
investigate whether apoptotic tumor cells trigger antitumor immunity independent 
of anticancer treatment. Local immune responses were evaluated after direct 
induction of tumor cell apoptosis using a Herpes simplex virus thymidine 
kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) system. The inflammatory response was 
significantly altered at the tumor site after apoptosis induction. The 
expression of cytokines and molecules that activate and suppress inflammation 
simultaneously increased. The HSV-tk/GCV-induced tumor cell apoptosis resulted 
in tumor growth suppression and promoted T lymphocyte infiltration into tumors. 
Therefore, the role of T cells after inducing tumor cell death was explored. CD8 
T cell depletion abrogated the antitumor efficacy of apoptosis induction, 
indicating that tumor regression was mainly dependent on CD8 T cells. 
Furthermore, CD4 T cell depletion inhibited tumor growth, suggesting the 
potential role of CD4 T cells in suppressive tumor immunity. Tumor tissues were 
evaluated after tumor cell apoptosis and CD4 T cell depletion to elucidate this 
immunological mechanism. Foxp3 and CTLA4, regulatory T-cell markers, decreased. 
Furthermore, arginase 1, an immune-suppressive mediator induced by myeloid 
cells, was significantly downregulated. These findings indicate that tumors 
accelerate CD8 T cell-dependent antitumor immunity and CD4 T cell-mediated 
suppressive immunity. These findings could be a therapeutic target for 
immunotherapy in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.","© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Science published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

demonstrate the application of this workflow, we applied it to two exemplary

rare and are histologically classified as germinomas and non-germinomatous with 
distinctive prognostic and therapeutic implications. ICGCTs, essentially due to 
the inherent difficulty of surgical access, pose different challenges and 
management connotations than their extracranial counterparts. This is a 
retrospective analysis of histologically verified ICGCTs, which was undertaken 
to evaluate various clinicopathological features and their implications on 
patient management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight histologically diagnosed cases (over 14 
years) of ICGCT at our institute formed the study cohort and were classified 
into germinoma and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). Additionally, 
germinomas were further subdivided on the basis of 1) tumor marker (TM) levels, 
as germinoma with normal TM, mildly elevated TM, and markedly elevated TM and 2) 
radiology features, as germinomas with typical radiology and atypical 
radiological features.
RESULTS: ICGCT with age ≤6 years (P = 0.049), elevated TM (P = 0.047), and NGGCT 
histology (P < 0.001) showed significantly worse outcomes. Furthermore, 
germinomas with markedly elevated TM and certain atypical radiological features 
showed prognosis akin to NGGCT.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of our largest single cancer center Indian patient cohort 
of ICGCT shows that inclusion of age ≤6 years, raised TM, and certain 
radiological features may assist clinicians in overcoming the limitations of 
surgical sampling, with better prognostication of histologically diagnosed 
germinomas.","DOI: 10.4103/0028-3886.378644

immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), but how omicron infection has affected the vaccine-induced and 
hybrid immunity is not well studied in Indian population. The present study was 
aimed to assess the durability and change in responses of humoral immunity with 
age, prior natural infection, vaccine type and duration with a minimum gap of 
six months post-two doses with either ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BBV152 prior- and 
post-emergence of the omicron variant.
METHODS: A total of 1300 participants were included in this observational study 
between November 2021 and May 2022. Participants had completed at least six 
months after vaccination (2 doses) with either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or an inactivated 
whole virus vaccine BBV152. They were grouped according to their age (≤ or ≥60 
yr) and prior exposure of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Five hundred and sixteen of 
these participants were followed up after emergence of the Omicron variant. The 
main outcome was durability and augmentation of the humoral immune response as 
determined by anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
concentrations, anti-nucleocapsid antibodies and anti-omicron RBD antibodies. 
Live virus neutralization assay was conducted for neutralizing antibodies 
against four variants - ancestral, delta and omicron and omicron sublineage 
BA.5.
RESULTS: Before the omicron surge, serum anti-RBD IgG antibodies were detected 
in 87 per cent participants after a median gap of eight months from the second 
vaccine dose, with a median titre of 114 [interquartile range (IQR) 32, 302] 
BAU/ml. The levels increased to 594 (252, 1230) BAU/ml post-omicron surge 
(P<0.001) with 97 per cent participants having detectable antibodies, although 
only 40 had symptomatic infection during the omicron surge irrespective of 
vaccine type and previous history of infection. Those with prior natural 
infection and vaccination had higher anti-RBD IgG titre at baseline, which 
increased further [352 (IQR 131, 869) to 816 (IQR 383, 2001) BAU/ml] (P<0.001). 
The antibody levels remained elevated after a mean time gap of 10 months, 
although there was a decline of 41 per cent. The geometric mean titre was 
452.54, 172.80, 83.1 and 76.99 against the ancestral, delta, omicron and omicron 
BA.5 variants in the live virus neutralization assay.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Anti-RBD IgG antibodies were detected in 85 per 
cent of participants after a median gap of eight months following the second 
vaccine dose. Omicron infection probably resulted in a substantial proportion of 
asymptomatic infection in the first four months in our study population and 
boosted the vaccine-induced humoral immune response, which declined but still 
remained durable over 10 months.","DOI: 10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_2521_22

disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia remain unclear. The present study was 
conducted to assess whether COVID-19 severity and other parameters are 
associated with CS-DPLA.
METHODS: The study participants included patients who recovered after acute 
severe COVID-19 and presented with CS-DPLA at two or six month follow up and 
control group (without CS-DPLA). Adults volunteers without any acute illness, 
chronic respiratory illness and without a history of severe COVID-19 were 
included as healthy controls for the biomarker study. The CS-DPLA was identified 
as a multidimensional entity involving clinical, radiological and physiological 
pulmonary abnormalities. The primary exposure was the neutrophil-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR). Recorded confounders included age, sex, peak lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), advanced respiratory support (ARS), length of hospital stay (LOS) and 
others; associations were analyzed using logistic regression. The baseline serum 
levels of surfactant protein D, cancer antigen 15-3 and transforming growth 
factor-β (TGF-β) were also compared among cases, controls and healthy 
volunteers.
RESULTS: We identified 91/160 (56.9%) and 42/144 (29.2%) participants with 
CS-DPLA at two and six months, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed 
associations of NLR, peak LDH, ARS and LOS with CS-DPLA at two months and of NLR 
and LOS at six months. The NLR was not independently associated with CS-DPLA at 
either visit. Only LOS independently predicted CS-DPLA at two months [adjusted 
odds ratios (aOR) (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.16 (1.07-1.25); P<0.001] and 
six months [aOR (95% CI) and 1.07 (1.01-1.12); P=0.01]. Participants with 
CS-DPLA at six months had higher baseline serum TGF-β levels than healthy 
volunteers.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Longer hospital stay was observed to be the only 
independent predictor of CS-DPLA six months after severe COVID-19. Serum TGF-β 
should be evaluated further as a biomarker.","DOI: 10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_2360_22

cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries such as 
India, representing 85 per cent of all sepsis-related deaths globally. Early 
diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment is challenging due to non-specific 
clinical manifestations and non-availability of rapid diagnostic tests. There is 
an urgent need for affordable diagnostics with fast turnaround time catering to 
the needs of end-users. Target product profiles (TPPs) have been found 
instrumental in developing 'fit-for-use' diagnostics, thus reducing the time 
taken to facilitate development and improving diagnosis. Hitherto, no such 
guidance or criteria has been defined for rapid diagnostics for sepsis/neonatal 
sepsis. We propose an innovative approach for developing the diagnostics for 
sepsis screening and diagnosis which can be utilized by diagnostic developers in 
the country.
METHODS: Thr@ee-round Delphi method, including two online surveys and one 
virtual consultation, was adopted to define criteria for minimum and optimum 
attributes of TPPs and build consensus on characteristics. Expert panel (n=23) 
included infectious disease physicians, public health specialists, clinical 
microbiologists, virologists, researchers/scientists and technology 
experts/innovators.
RESULTS: We present a three-component product profile for sepsis diagnosis, (i) 
screening with high sensitivity, (ii) detection of aetiological agent, and (iii) 
profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance, in adults and neonates 
with an option of testing different considerations. An agreement of >75 per cent 
was achieved for all TPP characteristics by Delphi. These TPPs are tailored to 
the Indian healthcare settings and can also be extrapolated to other 
resource-constraint and high-disease burden settings.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostics developed using these TPPs will 
facilitate utilization of invested resources leading to development of the 
products that have potential to ease the economic burden on patient and save 
lives.","DOI: 10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1936_22

miRNAs in nipple discharge and investigate the stability of miRNAs encapsulated 
in exosomes under degradative conditions. A novel TTMAAlPc-RNA complex method 
was used to measure the RNase concentration in colostrum and nipple discharge. 
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to test the 
stability of exogenous synthetic miRNAs (cel-lin-4-5p and cel-miR-2-3p) and 
endogenous miRNAs (hsa-miR-4732-5p, hsa-miR-3646, hsa-miR-4484, and 
kshv-miR-K12-5-5p). RNase was present and functional in colostrum and nipple 
discharge. Endogenous miRNAs were more stably expressed compared to exogenous 
miRNAs at room temperature and 4°C. Triton X-100 (1%, 30 min) destroyed the 
exosomal membrane, causing RNA degradation in colostrum but not in nipple 
discharge. Therefore, we confirmed that exosomes in colostrum and nipple 
discharge could protect miRNAs from degradation by RNase. Exosomes in nipple 
discharge may be more resistant to Triton X-100 lysis compared to those in the 
colostrum. Exosomal miRNAs in nipple discharge in breast cancer are stable under 
degradative conditions. Differential Triton X-100 sensitivity of exosomes of

(OC). The present paper focused on the action mechanism of FGD5-AS1 in OC. 
Clinical OC samples were collected for expression analyses of FGD5-AS1, RBBP6, 
and miR-107. The expression of FGD5-AS1, RBBP6, and miR-107 in OC cells was 
altered by transfection. OC cell proliferation was assessed by MTT and colony 
formation assays, and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) cultured with OC cell supernatants by matrigel angiogenesis assay. The 
interactions among FGD5-AS1, miR-107, and RBBP6 were detected by luciferase 
reporter assay. FGD5-AS1 and RBBP6 were strongly expressed and miR-107 was 
poorly expressed in clinical OC samples and OC cell lines. FGD5-AS1 or RBBP6 
overexpression in Hey and SKOV3 cells could potentiate OC cell proliferation and 
HUVEC angiogenesis, while FGD5-AS1 or RBBP6 knockdown in OC cells inhibited the 
above cellular processes. FGD5-AS1 targeted miR-107 to positively regulate RBBP6 
expression. Additionally, miR-107 overexpression or RBBP6 knockdown in SKOV3 
cells partially reversed the FGD5-AS1-dependent stimulation of OC cell 
proliferation and HUVEC angiogenesis. FGD5-AS1 may act as a promoter of OC via 
miR-107/RBBP6 axis.","DOI: 10.4103/cjop.CJOP-D-22-00084

to explore the role of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) in the 
progression of hypopharyngeal cancer and to identify the potential mechanisms. 
First, LSD1 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues 
and the correlation between LSD1 and the stage of HNSC were analyzed by the 
University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN). 
Following LSD1 silencing, proliferation of pharyngeal cancer cell line FaDu 
cells was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays. Wounding 
healing and transwell assays were used to measure the capacities of migration 
and invasion. In addition, expression of proteins related to 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), autophagy, and pyroptosis was tested 
by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence. After treatment with autophagy 
inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) 
inhibitor MCC950, the malignant biological properties were measured again. High 
LSD1 expression was observed in HNSC tissues, which was correlated with stage. 
LSD1 knockdown significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, 
and EMT of hypopharyngeal cancer cells. Moreover, autophagy and pyroptosis were 
induced by LSD1 depletion, observed by the enhanced fluorescence intensity of 
LC3, gasdermin-D (GSDMD)-N, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein 
containing a CARD (ASC), accompanied by upregulated expression of LC3II/LC3I, 
Beclin-1, NLRP3, cleaved-caspase 1, ASC, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-18 and 
downregulated expression of p62. Importantly, 3-MA or MCC950 addition obviously 
reversed the inhibitory effects of LSD1 silencing on the proliferation, 
migration, invasion, and EMT of hypopharyngeal cancer cells. To sum up, LSD1 
silencing could restrain the progression of hypopharyngeal cancer cells by 
inducing autophagy and pyroptosis.","DOI: 10.4103/cjop.CJOP-D-22-00137

240 mg (n = 111) or placebo (n = 110) plus ADT. After a median follow-up of 42.5 
months and despite crossover of 47 placebo recipients to open-label apalutamide, 
apalutamide reduced the risk of death by 32% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.68; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.13), risk of castration resistance by 69% (HR:

cutaneous and systemic findings, as well as variable disease severity phenotypes

affecting multiple regions such as oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and nasal 
region, each showing a distinct molecular profile. HNSCC accounts for more than 
6 million cases worldwide, soaring mainly in the developing countries.
RECENT FINDINGS: The aetiology of HNSCC is complex and multifactorial, involving 
both genetic and environmental factors. The critical role of microbiome, which 
includes bacteria, viruses, and fungi, is under spotlight due to the recent 
reports on their contribution in the development and progression of HNSCC. This 
review focuses on the effect of opportunistic pathogens on the host genome and 
epigenome, which contributes to the disease progression. Drawing parallels from 
the host-pathogen interactions observed in other tumour types arising from the 
epithelial tissue such as colorectal cancer, the review also calls attention to 
the potential explorations of the role of pathogens in HNSCC biology and 
discusses the clinical implications of microbiome research in detection and 
treatment of HNSCC.

response to treatment involves measuring cancer lesions on computed tomography 
(CT) imaging. The percentage change in size of specific lesions determines 
whether patients have had a complete/partial response or progressive disease, 
according to RECIST criteria. Dual Energy CT (DECT) permits additional 
measurements of iodine concentration, a surrogate marker of vascularity. Here we 
explore the role of changes in iodine concentration within cancer tissue on CT 
scans to assess its suitability for determining treatment response in patients 
with high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).
METHODS: Suitable RECIST measurable lesions were identified from the CT images 
of HGSOC patients, taken at 2 different time points (pre and post treatment). 
Changes in size and iodine concentration were measured for each lesion. PR/SD 
were classified as responders, PD was classified as non-responder. Radiological 
responses were correlated with clinical and CA125 outcomes.
RESULTS: 62 patients had appropriate imaging for assessment. 22 were excluded as 
they only had one DECT scan. 32/40 patients assessed (113 lesions) had received 
treatment for relapsed HGSOC. RECIST and GCIG (Gynaecologic Cancer Inter Group) 
CA125 criteria / clinical assessment of response for patients was correlated 
with changes in iodine concentration, before and after treatment. The prediction 
of median progression free survival was significantly better associated with 
changes in iodine concentration (p = 0.0001) and GCIG Ca125 / clinical 
assessment (p = 0.0028) in comparison to RECIST criteria (p = 0.43).
CONCLUSION: Changes in iodine concentration from dual energy CT imaging may be 
more suitable than RECIST in assessing response to treatment in patients with 
HGSOC.

the inhalation of mineral dust in the lungs, leading to lung dysfunction. 
Patients with pneumoconiosis are usually accompanied by weight loss, which 
suggests a lipid metabolism disorder. Recent progress in lipidomics uncovered 
detailed lipid profiles that play important roles in respiratory diseases, such 
as asthma, lung cancer and lung injury. The purpose of this study was to shed 
light on the different expression of lipidome between pneumoconiosis and 
healthy, hoping to bring new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of 
pneumoconiosis.
METHODOLOGY: This non-matching case-control study was performed among 96 
subjects (48 outpatients with male pneumoconiosis and 48 healthy volunteers), 
data of clinical phenotypes were recorded, and plasma biochemistry (lipidomic 
profiles) was tested for both pneumoconiosis patients and healthy controls. A 
total of 426 species in 11 lipid classes were analyzed by high-performance 
liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-QqQ-MS) for the cases and controls. We also analyzed the correlation of 
lipid profiles with clinical phenomes from pneumoconiosis patients by expression 
quantitative trait locus (eQTL) model to evaluate trans-nodules between 
lipidomic profiles and clinical phenomes. All visually re-checked data were 
analyzed using appropriate statistical tools (t-test or one-way ANOVA test) on 
SPSS.
RESULTS: Compared with healthy people, 26 significantly increased (> 1.5-fold) 
and 30 decreased lipid elements (< 2/threefold) in patients with pneumoconiosis 
were identified (P values all < 0.05). The majority of those elevated lipid 
elements were phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and the minority were free fatty 
acids (FFAs), while phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and lysophosphatidylcholines 
(lysoPCs) declined in pneumoconiosis. Clinical trans-omics analyses demonstrated 
that phenomes in pneumoconiosis connections with multiple lipids, which showed 
that pH, lung function, mediastinal lymph node calcification, and complication 
were highly correlated with lipid elements. Furthermore, up-regulated PE was 
corresponded to pH, smoking history and mediastinal lymph node calcification. PC 
was corresponded to dust exposure history, BMI and mediastinal lymph node 
calcification.
CONCLUSION: We found altered lipid panels between male pneumoconiosis patients 
and healthy people by qualitatively and quantitatively measured plasma lipidomic 
profiles. The trans-omic analysis between clinical phenomes and lipidomes might 
have the potential to uncover the heterogeneity of lipid metabolism of 
pneumoconiosis patients and to screen out clinically significant phenome-based 
lipid panels.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s41043-023-00400-7

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: To investigate CITED1 as a potential biomarker of anti-endocrine 
response and breast cancer recurrence, given its previously determined role in 
mediating estrogen-dependant transcription. The study is a continuation of 
earlier work establishing the role of CITED1 in mammary gland development.
RESULTS: CITED1 mRNA is associated with estrogen-receptor positivity and 
selectively expressed in the GOBO dataset of cell lines and tumours representing 
the luminal-molecular subtype. In patients treated with tamoxifen, higher CITED1 
correlated with better outcome, suggesting a role in anti-estrogen response. The 
effect was particularly evident in the subset of estrogen-receptor positive, 
lymph-node negative (ER+/LN-) patients although noticeable divergence of the 
groups was apparent only after five years. Tissue microarray (TMA) analysis 
further validated the association of CITED1 protein, by immunohistochemistry, 
with favourable outcome in ER+, tamoxifen-treated patients. Although we also 
found a favourable response to anti-endocrine treatment in a larger TCGA 
dataset, the tamoxifen-specific effect was not replicated. Finally, MCF7 cells 
overexpressing CITED1 showed selective amplification of AREG but not TGFα 
suggesting that maintenance of specific ERα-CITED1 mediated transcription is 
important for the long-term response to anti-endocrine therapy. These findings 
together confirm the proposed mechanism of action of CITED1 and support its 
potential use as a prognostic biomarker.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13104-023-06376-1

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The Dutch population-based cervical cancer screening programme (PBS) 
consists of primary high-risk human papilloma virus (hrHPV) testing with 
cytology as triage test. In addition to cervical scraping by a general 
practitioner (GP), women are offered self-sampling to increase participation. 
Because cytological examination on self-sampled material is not feasible, 
collection of cervical samples from hrHPV-positive women by a GP is required. 
This study aims to design a methylation marker panel to detect CIN3 or worse 
(CIN3+) in hrHPV-positive self-samples from the Dutch PBS as an alternative 
triage test for cytology.
METHODS: Fifteen individual host DNA methylation markers with high sensitivity 
and specificity for CIN3+ were selected from literature and analysed using 
quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) on DNA from hrHPV-positive 
self-samples from 208 women with CIN2 or less (< CIN2) and 96 women with CIN3+. 
Diagnostic performance was determined by area under the curve (AUC) of receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Self-samples were divided into a train 
and test set. Hierarchical clustering analysis to identify input methylation 
markers, followed by model-based recursive partitioning and robustness analysis 
to construct a predictive model, was applied to design the best marker panel.
RESULTS: QMSP analysis of the 15 individual methylation markers showed 
discriminative DNA methylation levels between < CIN2 and CIN3+ for all markers 
(p < 0.05). The diagnostic performance analysis for CIN3+ showed an AUC of ≥ 0.7 
(p < 0.001) for nine markers. Hierarchical clustering analysis resulted in seven 
clusters with methylation markers with similar methylation patterns (Spearman 
correlation> 0.5). Decision tree modeling revealed the best and most robust 
panel to contain ANKRD18CP, LHX8 and EPB41L3 with an AUC of 0.83 in the training 
set and 0.84 in the test set. Sensitivity to detect CIN3+ was 82% in the 
training set and 84% in the test set, with a specificity of 74% and 71%, 
respectively. Furthermore, all cancer cases (n = 5) were identified.
CONCLUSION: The combination of ANKRD18CP, LHX8 and EPB41L3 revealed good 
diagnostic performance in real-life self-sampled material. This panel shows 
clinical applicability to replace cytology in women using self-sampling in the 
Dutch PBS programme and avoids the extra GP visit after a hrHPV-positive 
self-sampling test.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13148-023-01517-6

Relative frequency of High grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and 
its associated deaths are highest in India which suggests the importance of 
understanding their immune profiles for better treatment modality. Hence, the 
present study investigated the NK cell receptor expression, their cognate 
ligands, serum cytokines, and soluble ligands in primary and recurrent HGSOC 
patients. We have used multicolor flow cytometry for immunophenotyping of tumor 
infiltrated and circulatory lymphocytes. Procartaplex, and ELISA were used to 
measure soluble ligands and cytokines of HGSOC patients.
RESULTS: Among the enrolled 51 EOC patients, 33 were primary high grade serous 
epithelial ovarian cancer (pEOC) and 18 were recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer 
(rEOC) patients. Blood samples from 46 age matched healthy controls (HC) were 
used for comparative analysis. Results revealed, frequency of circulatory 
CD56Bright NK, CD56Dim NK, NKT-like, and T cells was reduced with activating 
receptors while alterations in immune subsets with inhibitory receptors were 
observed in both groups. Study also highlights differential immune profile of 
primary and recurrent ovarian cancer patients. We have found increased soluble 
MICA which might have acted as ""decoy"" molecule and could be a reason of 
decrease in NKG2D positive subsets in both groups of patients. Furthermore, 
elevated level of serum cytokines IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in ovarian 
cancer patients, might be associated with ovarian cancer progression. Profiling 
of tumor infiltrated immune cells revealed the reduced level of DNAM-1 positive 
NK and T cells in both groups than their circulatory counterpart, which might 
have led to decrease in NK cell's ability of synapse formation.
CONCLUSIONS: The study brings out differential receptor expression profile on 
CD56BrightNK, CD56DimNK, NKT-like, and T cells, cytokines levels and soluble 
ligands which may be exploited to develop alternate therapeutic approaches for 
HGSOC patients. Further, few differences in the circulatory immune profiles 
between pEOC and rEOC cases, indicates the immune signature of pEOC undergoes 
some changes in circulation that might facilitated the disease relapse. They 
also maintains some common immune signatures such as reduced expression of 
NKG2D, high level of MICA as well as IL-6, IL10 and TNF-α, which indicates 
irreversible immune suppression of ovarian cancer patients. It is also 
emphasized that a restoration of cytokines level, NKG2D and DNAM-1on tumor 
infiltrated immune cells may be targeted to develop specific therapeutic 
approaches for high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13048-023-01192-4

children with a recent cancer diagnosis.
PROCEDURE: This feasibility study was a single-group mixed methods study, 
consisting of pre- and post-intervention assessment, followed by a survey and 
interviews of parents. Participants were children and adolescents with a new 
cancer diagnosis. The physiotherapy model of care consisted of education, 
surveillance, standardised assessment, individually tailored exercise and a 
fitness tracker.
RESULTS: All participants (n = 14) completed over 75% of the supervised exercise 
sessions. No safety or adverse events occurred. Over the 8-week intervention 
period, an average of 7.5 supervised sessions were completed per participant. 
The overall experience provided by the physiotherapist service was rated as 
excellent by 86% (n = 12) and very good by 14% (n = 2) of parents. All parents 
surveyed (n = 14) rated the level of support provided by the physiotherapy

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has caused a global health 
challenge with high mortality of severe or critically ill patients with 
COVID-19. To date, there is no specific efficient therapeutics for severe or 
critically ill patients with COVID-19. It has been reported that androgen is 
related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection. Proxalutamide as an androgen receptor antagonist has shown potential 
treatment effects on COVID-19 patients. Thus, this trial is designed to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of proxalutamide in severe or critically ill 
patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: This single-arm, open-label, single-center prospective exploratory 
trial is planned to recruit 64 severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 
in China. Recruitment started on 16 May 2022 and is foreseen to end on 16 May 
2023. Patients will be followed-up until 60 days or death, whichever comes 
first. The primary outcome is the 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary 
endpoints included 60-day all-cause mortality, rate of clinical deterioration 
within 30 days after administration, time to sustain clinical recovery 
(determined using an 8-point ordinal scale), mean change in the Acute Physiology 
and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, change in oxygenation index, changes in 
chest CT scan, percentage of patients confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 by 
nasopharyngeal swab, change in Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 and safety. Visits will 
be performed on days 1 (baseline), 15 or 30, 22, and 60.
DISCUSSION: The trial is the first to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
proxalutamide in severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19. The findings 
of this study might lead to the development of better treatment for COVID-19 and 
provide convincing evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of proxalutamide.

cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about CVD risk assessment and 
breast cancer in Korean women. We hypothesized that Korean breast cancer 
survivors would have higher risks of future CVD within the next 10 years (i.e., 
Framingham Risk Score [FRS]) than women without cancer.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To compare FRS-based CVD risks in women with and without breast 
cancer based on propensity score matching; and (2) To explore adiposity-related 
measures in relation to FRS in Korean women with breast cancer.
METHODS: Using the cross-sectional data from the 2014-2018 Korean National 
Health and National Survey (KNHANES), we identified 136 women with breast cancer 
aged 30-74 years who had no other cancer and no CVD. The comparison group of 544 
women with no cancer were selected by 1:4 nearest-neighbor propensity score 
matching based on breast cancer diagnosis. CVD risk was assessed by FRS based on 
multiple traditional risk factors (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, 
and smoking). Adiposity was measured by physical examination, including body 
mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Physical activity and health 
behaviors were assessed by self-reports.
RESULTS: Women with breast cancer (mean age of 57 years) had similar FRS levels 
at a low-risk category (< 10%) to women with no cancer (4.9% vs. 5.5%). Breast 
cancer survivors (mean 8.5 survival years) presented at significantly lower 
levels of total cholesterol, BMI, and WHtR (all p values < 0.05) than their 
counterpart. Within the breast cancer group, WHtR ≥ 0.5 was associated with 
higher FRS, compared to WHtR < 0.5. FRS was not different by survival < 5 years 
or ≥ 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: FRS-based CVD risks were not different in Korean, mostly 
postmenopausal, women by breast cancer status. Whereas breast cancer survivors 
had even lower levels of lipid and adiposity measures than women without cancer, 
those values indicating borderline cardiometabolic risk suggest continued 
screening and management efforts for these aging women. Future studies are 
needed to examine longitudinal trajectories of CVD risk factors and CVD outcomes 
among Korean breast cancer survivors.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-16063-2

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Exosomal circRNA, as an essential mediator of the follicular 
microenvironment, has been implicated in the etiological and pathobiological 
studies of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This study aimed to determine 
abnormal circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles in follicle fluid (FF) 
exosomes in patients with PCOS and identify the role of circ_0008285/microRNA 
(miR)-4644/low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) axis in PCOS.
METHODS: Sixty-seven women undergoing IVF/ICSI, 31 PCOS patients and 36 non-PCOS 
patients were included in the cohort study. The circRNA expression profiles of 
FF exosomes in PCOS (n = 3) and control group (n = 3) were compared by RNA 
sequencing. In an additional cohort (PCOS:28 vs Control:33), the mRNA expression 
levels of four circRNAs from FF exosomes were further verified by qRT-PCR. 
Bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase reporter gene assay verified the 
relationship between circ_0008285 and miR-4644 and between miR-4644 and LDLR. 
KGN cells were infected with sh-circ0008285 and transfected with miR-4644 mimic 
to verify their roles in lipid metabolism.
RESULTS: Four circRNAs showed significantly different expressions. Circ_0044234 
was overexpressed in PCOS patients, while circ_0006877, circ_0013167 and 
circ0008285 were decreased in PCOS. Among four differentially expressed 
circRNAs, circ0008285 was enriched in lipoprotein particle receptor activity and 
cholesterol metabolism pathway by GO and KEGG pathway analyses. Luciferase assay 
confirmed the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network circ_0008285/miR-4644 
/LDLR. The intercellular experiments on circ_0008285 and its reduction in KGN 
cells showed that the consumption of circ_0008285 in exosomes could increase the 
expression of miR-4644 in recipient cells and inhibit the expression of LDLR, as 
well as increase free fatty acid secretion.
CONCLUSION: Circ_0008285 can combine with miR-4644 to promote the expression of 
LDLR and affect the cholesterol metabolism of ovarian granulosa cells in PCOS. 
Our findings revealed the ceRNA network of circ_0008285 and provided a new path 
to investigate lipid metabolism abnormalities in PCOS.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13048-023-01199-x

homeostasis and microbiota balance. Commensal E. coli is known to promote the 
regeneration of damaged colon epithelial cells. The aim of the study was to 
investigate the connection between E. coli and Fpr2 in the recovery of colon 
epithelial cells.
RESULTS: The deficiency of Fpr2 was associated with impaired integrity of the 
colon mucosa and an imbalance of microbiota, characterized by the enrichment of 
Proteobacteria in the colon. Two serotypes of E. coli, O22:H8 and O91:H21, were 
identified in the mouse colon through complete genome sequencing. E. coli O22:H8 
was found to be prevalent in the gut of mice and exhibited lower virulence 
compared to O91:H21. Germ-free (GF) mice that were pre-orally inoculated with E. 
coli O22:H8 showed reduced susceptibility to chemically induced colitis, 
increased proliferation of epithelial cells, and improved mouse survival. 
Following infection with E. coli O22:H8, the expression of Fpr2 in colon 
epithelial cells was upregulated, and the products derived from E. coli O22:H8 
induced migration and proliferation of colon epithelial cells through Fpr2. Fpr2 
deficiency increased susceptibility to chemically induced colitis, delayed the 
repair of damaged colon epithelial cells, and heightened inflammatory responses. 
Additionally, the population of E. coli was observed to increase in the colons 
of Fpr2-/- mice with colitis.
CONCLUSION: Commensal E. coli O22:H8 stimulated the upregulation of Fpr2 
expression in colon epithelial cells, and the products from E. coli induced 
migration and proliferation of colon epithelial cells through Fpr2. Fpr2 
deficiency led to an increased E. coli population in the colon and delayed 
recovery of damaged colon epithelial cells in mice with colitis. Therefore, Fpr2 
is essential for the effects of commensal E. coli on colon epithelial cell 
recovery.","© 2023. This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the

growing attention in cancer pain care. This study aimed to develop a cancer pain 
management program based on belief modification to improve the cancer pain 
experience of Chinese oral cancer survivors and to explore the acceptability and 
preliminary outcomes of the Cancer Pain Belief Modification Program (CPBMP).
METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was applied to develop and revise the program. 
The CPBMP was developed and revised using the Delphi technique, and its further 
improvement was explored with a one-group pre- and post-trial designed with a 
sample of 16 Chinese oral cancer survivors, and semi-structured interviews. 
Research instruments included Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Chinese version of 
Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised for Cancer Pain (IPQ-CaCP), and the 
University of Washington Quality of Life assessment scale (UW-QOL). Descriptive 
statistics, t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyse the data. The 
semi-structured questions were analysed using content analysis.
RESULTS: The six-module CPBMP was endorsed by most experts and patients. The 
expert authority coefficient value was 0.75 in the first round of the Delphi 
survey and 0.78 in the second round. The ""pain intense"", ""negative pain beliefs"" 
scores of pre- and post-testing decreased from 5.63 ± 0.48 to 0.81 ± 0.54 
(t = -3.746, p < 0.001); from 140.63 ± 9.02 to 52.75 ± 7.27 (Z = 12.406, 
p < 0.001); and the ""positive pain beliefs"", ""quality of life"" scores increased 
from 55.13 ± 4.54 to 66.00 ± 4.70 (Z = -6.983, p < 0.001); from 66.97 ± 15.01 to 
86.69 ± 8.42 (Z = 7.283, p < 0.001). The qualitative data also indicated that 
CPBMP was well acceptable.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed the acceptability and preliminary outcomes of CPBMP 
patients. CPBMP improves the pain experience of Chinese oral cancer patients and 
provides a reference for cancer pain management in the future.

some limitations, such as the development of side effects and drug resistance. 
Furthermore, monotherapy is often less effective against heterogeneous cancer 
tissues. Combination therapies of cytotoxic anticancer drugs with molecularly 
targeted drugs have been pursued to solve such fundamental problems. Nanvuranlat 
(JPH203 or KYT-0353), an inhibitor for L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1; 
SLC7A5), has novel mechanisms of action to suppress the cancer cell 
proliferation and tumor growth by inhibiting the transport of large neutral 
amino acids into cancer cells. This study investigated the potential of the 
combined use of nanvuranlat and cytotoxic anticancer drugs.
METHODS: The combination effects of cytotoxic anticancer drugs and nanvuranlat 
on cell growth were examined by a water-soluble tetrazolium salt assay in 
two-dimensional cultures of pancreatic and biliary tract cancer cell lines. To 
elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the combination of 
gemcitabine and nanvuranlat, we investigated apoptotic cell death and cell cycle 
by flow cytometry. The phosphorylation levels of amino acid-related signaling 
pathways were analyzed by Western blot. Furthermore, growth inhibition was 
examined in cancer cell spheroids.
RESULTS: All the tested seven types of cytotoxic anticancer drugs combined with 
nanvuranlat significantly inhibited the cell growth of pancreatic cancer MIA 
PaCa-2 cells compared to their single treatment. Among them, the combined 
effects of gemcitabine and nanvuranlat were relatively high and confirmed in 
multiple pancreatic and biliary tract cell lines in two-dimensional cultures. 
The growth inhibitory effects were suggested to be additive but not synergistic 
under the tested conditions. Gemcitabine generally induced cell cycle arrest at 
the S phase and apoptotic cell death, while nanvuranlat induced cell cycle 
arrest at the G0/G1 phase and affected amino acid-related mTORC1 and GAAC 
signaling pathways. In combination, each anticancer drug basically exerted its 
own pharmacological activities, although gemcitabine more strongly influenced 
the cell cycle than nanvuranlat. The combination effects of growth inhibition 
were also verified in cancer cell spheroids.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the potential of first-in-class LAT1 
inhibitor nanvuranlat as a concomitant drug with cytotoxic anticancer drugs, 
especially gemcitabine, on pancreatic and biliary tract cancers.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12935-023-02957-z

infancy commonly resulting in post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, periventricular 
leukomalacia, and subsequent neurocognitive deficits. We demonstrate vascular 
expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin after GMH and investigate a 
strategy to specifically target complement inhibition to sites of P-selectin 
expression to mitigate the pathological sequelae of GMH.
METHODS: We prepared two fusion proteins consisting of different anti-P-selectin 
single chain antibodies (scFv's) linked to the complement inhibitor Crry. One 
scFv targeting vehicle (2.12scFv) blocked the binding of P-selectin to its 
PSGL-1 ligand expressed on leukocytes, whereas the other targeting vehicle 
(2.3scFv) bound P-selectin without blocking ligand binding. Post-natal C57BL/6 J 
mice on day 4 (P4) were subjected to collagenase induced-intraventricular 
hemorrhage and treated with 2.3Psel-Crry, 2.12Psel-Crry, or vehicle.
RESULTS: Compared to vehicle treatment, 2.3Psel-Crry treatment after induction 
of GMH resulted in reduced lesion size and mortality, reduced hydrocephalus 
development, and improved neurological deficit measurements in adolescence. In 
contrast, 2.12Psel-Crry treatment resulted in worse outcomes compared to 
vehicle. Improved outcomes with 2.3Psel-Crry were accompanied by decreased 
P-selectin expression, and decreased complement activation and microgliosis. 
Microglia from 2.3Psel-Crry treated mice displayed a ramified morphology, 
similar to naïve mice, whereas microglia in vehicle treated animals displayed a 
more ameboid morphology that is associated with a more activated status. 
Consistent with these morphological characteristics, there was increased 
microglial internalization of complement deposits in vehicle compared to 
2.3Psel-Crry treated animals, reminiscent of aberrant C3-dependent microglial 
phagocytosis that occurs in other (adult) types of brain injury. In addition, 
following systemic injection, 2.3Psel-Crry specifically targeted to the post-GMH 
brain. Likely accounting for the unexpected finding that 2.12Psel-Crry worsens 
outcome following GMH was the finding that this construct interfered with 
coagulation in this hemorrhagic condition, and specifically with heterotypic 
platelet-leukocyte aggregation, which express P-selectin and PSGL-1, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: GMH induces expression of P-selectin, the targeting of which with a 
complement inhibitor protects against pathogenic sequelae of GMH. A dual 
functioning construct with both P-selectin and complement blocking activity 
interferes with coagulation and worsens outcomes following GMH, but has 
potential for treatment of conditions that incorporate pathological thrombotic 
events, such as ischemic stroke.","© 2023. This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the

role in tumorigenesis and tumor microenvironment formation in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). We investigated how IRGs regulates the HCC immunophenotype and 
thus affects the prognosis and response to immunotherapy.
METHODS: We investigated RNA expression of IRGs and developed an immune-related 
genes-based prognostic index (IRGPI) in HCC samples. Then, the influence of the 
IRGPI on the immune microenvironment was comprehensively analysed.
RESULTS: According to IRGPI, HCC patients are divided into two immune subtypes. 
A high IRGPI was characterized by an increased tumor mutation burden (TMB) and a 
poor prognosis. More CD8 + tumor infiltrating cells and expression of PD-L1 were 
observed in low IRGPI subtypes. Two immunotherapy cohorts confirmed patients 
with low IRGPI demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits. Multiplex 
immunofluorescence staining determined that there were more CD8 + T cells 
infiltrating into tumor microenvironment in IRGPI-low groups, and the survival 
time of these patients was longer.

radiotherapy is considered the standard of care for most solid tumors, including 
lung, breast, esophageal, and colorectal cancers and glioblastoma. Resistance to 
radiation can lead to local treatment failure and even cancer recurrence.

that cause resistance of cancer to radiation therapy, including 
radiation-induced DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis escape, 
abundance of cancer stem cells, modification of cancer cells and their 
microenvironment, presence of exosomal and non-coding RNA, metabolic 
reprogramming, and ferroptosis. We aim to focus on the molecular mechanisms of 
cancer radiotherapy resistance in relation to these aspects and to discuss 
possible targets to improve treatment outcomes.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: In recent years, multiple coagulation and fibrinolysis (CF) indexes 
have been reported to be significantly related to the progression and prognosis 
of some cancers.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to comprehensively analyze the value of 
CF parameters in prognosis prediction of pancreatic cancer (PC).
METHODS: The preoperative coagulation related data, clinicopathological 
information, and survival data of patients with pancreatic tumor were collected 
retrospectively. Mann Whitney U test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox 
proportional hazards regression model were applied to analyze the differences of 
coagulation indexes between benign and malignant tumors, as well as the roles of 
these indexes in PC prognosis prediction.
RESULTS: Compared with benign tumors, the preoperative levels of some 
traditional coagulation and fibrinolysis (TCF) indexes (such as TT, Fibrinogen, 
APTT, and D-dimer) were abnormally increased or decreased in patients with 
pancreatic cancer, as well as Thromboelastography (TEG) parameters (such as R, 
K, α Angle, MA, and CI). Kaplan Meier survival analysis based on resectable PC 
patients showed that the overall survival (OS) of patients with elevated α 
angle, MA, CI, PT, D-dimer, or decreased PDW was markedly shorter than other 
patients; moreover, patients with lower CI or PT have longer disease-free 
survival. Further univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that PT, 
D-dimer, PDW, vascular invasion (VI), and tumor size (TS) were independent risk 
factors for poor prognosis of PC. According to the results of modeling group and 
validation group, the nomogram model based on independent risk factors could 
effectively predict the postoperative survival of PC patients.
CONCLUSION: Many abnormal CF parameters were remarkably correlated with PC 
prognosis, including α Angle, MA, CI, PT, D-dimer, and PDW. Furthermore, only 
PT, D-dimer, and PDW were independent prognostic indicators for poor prognosis 
of PC, and the prognosis prediction model based on these indicators was an 
effective tool to predict the postoperative survival of PC.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-10908-0

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: As an adult tumor with the most invasion and the highest mortality 
rate, the inherent heterogeneity of glioblastoma (GBM) is the main factor that 
causes treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to have a deeper 
understanding of the pathology of GBM. Some studies have shown that Eukaryotic 
Initiation Factor 4A-3 (EIF4A3) can promote the growth of many people's tumors, 
and the role of specific molecules in GBM remains unclear.
METHODS: The correlation between the expression of EIF4A3 gene and its prognosis 
was studied in 94 GBM patients using survival analysis. Further in vitro and in 
vivo experiments, the effect of EIF4A3 on GBM cells proliferation, migration, 
and the mechanism of EIF4A3 on GBM was explored. In addition, combined with 
bioinformatics analysis, we further confirmed that EIF4A3 contributes to the 
progress of GBM.
RESULTS: The expression of EIF4A3 was upregulated in GBM tissues, and high 
expression of EIF4A3 is associated with poor prognosis in GBM. In vitro, 
knockdown of EIF4A3 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and 
invasion abilities of GBM cells, whereas overexpression of EIF4A3 led to the 
opposite effect. The analysis of differentially expressed genes related to 
EIF4A3 indicates that it is involved in many cancer-related pathways, such as 
Notch and JAK-STAT3 signal pathway. In Besides, we demonstrated the interaction 
between EIF4A3 and Notch1 by RNA immunoprecipitation. Finally, the biological 
function of EIF4A3-promoted GBM was confirmed in living organisms.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that EIF4A3 may be a potential 
prognostic factor, and Notch1 participates in the proliferation and metastasis 
of GBM cells mediated by EIF4A3.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-10946-8

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the 
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, long-term survival 
outcomes and treatment response of HCC patients undergoing immunotherapy is 
unpredictable. The study aimed to evaluate the role of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 
combined with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to predict the prognosis and 
treatment response of HCC patients receiving ICIs.
METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC who received ICI treatment were 
included. The HCC immunotherapy score was developed from a retrospective cohort 
at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital to form the training cohort. The 
clinical variables independently associated with overall survival (OS) were 
identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Based on 
multivariate analysis of OS, a predictive score based on AFP and NLR was 
constructed, and patients were stratified into three risk groups according to 
this score. The clinical utility of this score to predict progression-free 
survival (PFS) and differentiate objective response rate (ORR) and disease 
control rate (DCR) was also performed. This score was validated in an 
independent external validation cohort at the First Affiliated Hospital of 
Wenzhou Medical University.
RESULTS: Baseline AFP ≤ 400 ng/ml (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.97; 
P = 0.039) and NLR ≤ 2.77 (HR 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.37; P<0.001) were found to be 
independent risk factors of OS. The two labolatory values were used to develop 
the score to predict survival outcomes and treatment response in HCC patients 
receiving immunotherapy, which assigned 1 point for AFP > 400 ng/ml and 3 points 
for NLR > 2.77. Patients with 0 point were classified as the low-risk group. 
Patients with 1-3 points were categorized as the intermediate-risk group. 
Patients with 4 points were classified as the high-risk group. In the training 
cohort, the median OS of the low-risk group was not reached. The median OS of 
the intermediate-risk group and high-risk group were 29.0 (95% CI 20.8-37.3) 
months and 16.0 (95% CI 10.8-21.2) months, respectively (P < 0.001). The median 
PFS of the low-risk group was not reached. The median PFS of the 
intermediate-risk group and high-risk group were 14.6 (95% CI 11.3-17.8) months 
and 7.6 (95% CI 3.6-11.7) months, respectively (P < 0.001). The ORR and DCR were 
highest in the low-risk group, followed by the intermediate-risk group and the 
high-risk group (P < 0.001, P = 0.007, respectively). This score also had good 
predictive power using the validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: The HCC immunotherapy score based on AFP and NLR can predict 
survival outcomes and treatment response in patients receiving ICI treatments, 
suggesting that this score could serve as a useful tool for identification of 
HCC patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-11003-0

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been recognized as an effective 
therapeutic option for locally advanced gastric cancer as it is expected to 
reduce tumor size, increase the resection rate, and improve overall survival. 
However, for patients who are not responsive to NAC, the best operation timing 
may be missed together with suffering from side effects. Therefore, it is 
paramount to differentiate potential respondents from non-respondents. 
Histopathological images contain rich and complex data that can be exploited to 
study cancers. We assessed the ability of a novel deep learning (DL)-based 
biomarker to predict pathological responses from images of hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E)-stained tissue.
METHODS: In this multicentre observational study, H&E-stained biopsy sections of 
patients with gastric cancer were collected from four hospitals. All patients 
underwent NAC followed by gastrectomy. The Becker tumor regression grading (TRG) 
system was used to evaluate the pathologic chemotherapy response. Based on 
H&E-stained slides of biopsies, DL methods (Inception-V3, Xception, 
EfficientNet-B5, and ensemble CRSNet models) were employed to predict the 
pathological response by scoring the tumor tissue to obtain a histopathological 
biomarker, the chemotherapy response score (CRS). The predictive performance of 
the CRSNet was evaluated.
RESULTS: 69,564 patches from 230 whole-slide images of 213 patients with gastric 
cancer were obtained in this study. Based on the F1 score and area under the 
curve (AUC), an optimal model was finally chosen, named the CRSNet model. Using 
the ensemble CRSNet model, the response score derived from H&E staining images 
reached an AUC of 0.936 in the internal test cohort and 0.923 in the external 
validation cohort for predicting pathological response. The CRS of major 
responders was significantly higher than that of minor responders in both 
internal and external test cohorts (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the proposed DL-based biomarker (CRSNet model) 
derived from histopathological images of the biopsy showed potential as a 
clinical aid for predicting the response to NAC in patients with locally 
advanced GC. Therefore, the CRSNet model provides a novel tool for the 
individualized management of locally advanced gastric cancer.","© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The International Gastric

quantification and image quality (IQ) of the clinically utilized PET [18F]FDG 
whole-body protocols in Finland using a NEMA/IEC IQ phantom permanently filled 
with 68Ge.
METHODS: The phantom was imaged on 14 PET-CT scanners, including a variety of 
models from two major vendors. The variability of the recovery coefficients 
(RCmax, RCmean and RCpeak) of the hot spheres as well as percent background 
variability (PBV), coefficient of variation of the background (COVBG) and 
accuracy of corrections (AOC) were studied using images from clinical and 
standardized protocols with 20 repeated measurements. The ranges of the RCs were 
also compared to the limits of the EARL 18F standards 2 accreditation (EARL2). 
The impact of image noise on these parameters was studied using averaged images 
(AVIs).
RESULTS: The largest variability in RC values of the routine protocols was found 
for the RCmax with a range of 68% and with 10% intra-scanner variability, 
decreasing to 36% when excluding protocols with suspected cross-calibration 
failure or without point-spread-function (PSF) correction. The RC ranges of 
individual hot spheres in routine or standardized protocols or AVIs fulfilled 
the EARL2 ranges with two minor exceptions, but fulfilling the exact EARL2 
limits for all hot spheres was variable. RCpeak was less dependent on averaging 
and reconstruction parameters than RCmax and RCmean. The PBV, COVBG and AOC 
varied between 2.3-11.8%, 9.6-17.8% and 4.8-32.0%, respectively, for the routine 
protocols. The RC ranges, PBV and COVBG were decreased when using AVIs. With 
AOC, when excluding routine protocols without PSF correction, the maximum value 
dropped to 15.5%.
CONCLUSION: The maximum variability of the RC values for the [18F]FDG whole-body 
protocols was about 60%. The RC ranges of properly cross-calibrated scanners 
with PSF correction fitted to the EARL2 RC ranges for individual sphere sizes, 
but fulfilling the exact RC limits would have needed further optimization. 
RCpeak was the most robust RC measure. Besides COVBG, also RCs and PVB were 
sensitive to image noise.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40658-023-00551-w

non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, 479 treatment-naive patients 
with stage IV squamous or non-squamous NSCLC without known EGFR sensitizing 
mutations, ALK, ROS1 or RET fusions were randomized (2:1) to receive 1,200 mg of 
sugemalimab (n = 320) or placebo (n = 159) every 3 weeks in combination with 
platinum-based chemotherapy for up to four cycles, followed by maintenance 
therapy with sugemalimab or placebo for squamous NSCLC and sugemalimab or 
placebo plus pemetrexed for non-squamous NSCLC. Placebo-treated patients could 
cross over to receive sugemalimab monotherapy on disease progression. The 
primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and 
the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response 
rate. Sugemalimab plus chemotherapy has demonstrated significant PFS 
prolongation in the primary analysis as reported previously. As of 22 November 
2021, the prespecified interim OS analysis showed significant improvement with 
the addition of sugemalimab to chemotherapy (median OS = 25.4 versus 16.9 
months; hazard ratio = 0.65; 95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.84; P = 0.0008). 
Sugemalimab plus chemotherapy provided superior PFS and OS compared to placebo 
plus chemotherapy, supporting the use of sugemalimab as a first-line treatment 
option for metastatic NSCLC.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","DOI: 10.1038/s43018-023-00578-z

The ""self-medication hypothesis"" posits that individuals may use substances such 
as tobacco and alcohol to cope with symptoms associated with untreated mental 
health problems. The present study examined the association between having a 
currently untreated mental health condition and tobacco and alcohol use among 
male taxi drivers in NYC, a population at risk for poor mental and physical 
health outcomes.
METHODS: The sample included 1105 male, ethnoracially diverse, primarily 
foreign-born NYC taxi drivers participating in a health fair program. This 
secondary cross-sectional analysis utilized logistic regression modeling to 
examine whether endorsement of a currently untreated mental health problem 
(i.e., depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder) was associated 
with alcohol and/or tobacco use, controlling for potential confounders.
RESULTS: 8.5% of drivers reported having mental health problems; among these, 
only 0.5% reported receiving treatment. Untreated mental health problems were 
associated with an increased risk of current tobacco/alcohol use after 
controlling for age, educational attainment, nativity, and pain history: drivers 
with untreated mental health problems had 1.9x the odds of reporting current 
tobacco use [95% CI: 1.10-3.19] and 1.6x the odds of reporting current alcohol 
use [95% CI: 1.01-2.46] than those without untreated mental health problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Few drivers with mental health problems receive treatment. In line 
with the self-medication hypothesis, drivers with untreated mental health 
problems demonstrated significantly increased risk of tobacco and alcohol use. 
Efforts to encourage timely screening and treatment of mental health problems 
among taxi drivers are warranted.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Patients with early esophageal squamous cell neoplasias (ESCNs) that 
are totally or nearly totally circumferential face challenges in their clinical 
work. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) frequently leads to esophageal 
strictures. Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which stands out for its 
simplicity of use and low rate of stenosis, is a rapidly evolving therapeutic 
strategy for early ESCNs. We contrast ESD with RFA in order to find which method 
is best for the treatment of a wide range of esophageal diseases.
METHODS: Patients who had flat-type, early, large ESCNs (extending more than 3/4 
of the esophageal circumference) treated endoscopically were enrolled 
retrospectively. The primary outcome measurements were adverse events and local 
control of the neoplastic lesion.
RESULTS: A total of 105 patients received treatment; 60 had ESD and 45 received 
RFA. Despite the patients receiving RFA typically having larger tumors (14.27 
vs. 5.70 cm, P < 0.05), the local control of the neoplastic lesion and 
procedure-related complications were comparable between the ESD and RFA groups. 
A considerably higher risk of esophageal stenosis was observed in patients with 
extensive lesions in the ESD group compared to the RFA group (60% vs. 31%; 
P < 0.05), and the rate of refractory stricture is also higher than that of the 
RFA.
CONCLUSION: Both RFA and ESD are effective in treating large, flat, early ESCNs; 
however, ESD is more likely to cause side effects, such as esophageal stricture, 
particularly in lesions that are larger than 3/4 of the diameter. Before RFA, a 
more precise and thorough pretreatment examination should be performed. A more 
accurate pretreatment evaluation will be an important development direction for 
early esophageal cancer in future. After surgery, a strict routine review is 
crucial.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block is a recent development in the 
field of regional anaesthesia and has been increasingly explored for abdominal 
surgeries to reduce opioid use and improve pain control. Colorectal cancer is 
the commonest cancer in multi-ethnic Singapore and requires surgery for curative 
treatment. ESP is a promising alternative in colorectal surgeries, but few 
studies have evaluated its efficacy in such surgeries. Therefore, this study 
aims to evaluate the use of ESP blocks in laparoscopic colorectal surgeries to 
establish its safety and efficacy in this field.
METHODS: A prospective two-armed interventional cohort study comparing T8-T10 
ESP blocks with conventional multimodal intravenous analgesia for laparoscopic 
colectomies was conducted in a single institution in Singapore. The decision for 
doing an ESP block versus conventional multimodal intravenous analgesia was made 
by a consensus between the attending surgeon and anesthesiologist. Outcomes 
measured were total intra-operative opioid consumption, post-operative pain 
control and patient outcome. Post-operative pain control was measured by pain 
score, analgesia use, and amount of opioids consumed. Patient outcome was 
determined by presence of ileus.
RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were included, of which 30 patients received an 
ESP block. Overall, the ESP group had a significantly lower median opioid usage 
both intra-operatively and post-operatively (p = 0.031). Fewer patients required 
patient-controlled analgesia and rescue analgesia post-operatively for pain 
control (p < 0.001) amongst the ESP group. Pain scores were similar and 
post-operative ileus was absent in both groups. Multivariate analysis found that 
the ESP block had an independent effect on reducing intra-opioid consumption 
(p = 0.014). Multivariate analysis of post-operative opioid use and pain scores 
did not yield statistically significant results.
CONCLUSIONS: The ESP block was an effective alternative regional anaesthesia for 
colorectal surgery that reduced intra-operative and post-operative opioid use 
while attaining satisfactory pain control.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

invasive esophagectomy (MIE) when performed in three-dimensional versus 
two-dimensional visualization system, and investigate the learning curve of a 
single surgeon who implemented three-dimensional McKeown MIE.
METHODS: A total of 335 consecutive cases (three-dimensional or two-dimensional) 
were identified. Perioperative clinical parameters were compared and cumulative 
sum learning curve was plotted. Propensity score matching was used to reduce 
selection bias from confounding factors.
RESULTS: Patients in three-dimensional group were associated with more chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (23.9% vs 3.0%, p < 0.01). After propensity score 
matching (108 matched patients in each groups), this finding was no longer 
statistically significant. Comparing to two-dimensional group, significant 
improvement in total retrieved lymph nodes (28 vs 33, p = 0.003) was observed in 
three-dimensional group. In addition, more lymph nodes around the right 
recurrent laryngeal nerve were harvested in three-dimensional group than that in 
two-dimensional group (p = 0.045). However, there were no significantly 
differences were found between the two groups in terms of other intraoperative 
parameters (e.g., operative time) and postoperative relevant outcomes (e.g., 
lung infection). Furthermore, the change point in the cumulative sum learning 
curves for intraoperative blood loss and thoracic procedure time was 33 
procedures, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional visualization system appears to be superior in 
performing lymphadenectomy during McKeown MIE to that of a two-dimensional 
technique. For surgeons proficient in performing two-dimensional McKeown MIE, 
the learning curve for a three-dimensional procedure appears to begin near 
proficiency after more than 33 cases.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: In breast conserving surgery, accurate lesion localization is essential 
for obtaining adequate surgical margins. Preoperative wire localization (WL) and 
radioactive seed localization (RSL) are widely accepted methods to guide 
surgical excision of nonpalpable breast lesions but are limited by logistical 
challenges, migration issues, and legislative complexities. Radiofrequency 
identification (RFID) technology may offer a viable alternative. The purpose of 
this study was to evaluate the feasibility, clinical acceptability, and safety 
of RFID surgical guidance for localization of nonpalpable breast cancer.
METHODS: In a prospective multicentre cohort study, the first 100 RFID 
localization procedures were included. The primary outcome was the percentage of 
clear resection margins and re-excision rate. Secondary outcomes included 
procedure details, user experience, learningcurve, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Between April 2019 and May 2021, 100 women underwent RFID guided breast 
conserving surgery. Clear resection margins were obtained in 89 out of 96 
included patients (92.7%), re-excision was indicated in three patients (3.1%). 
Radiologists reported difficulties with the placement of the RFID tag, partially 
related to the relatively large needle-applicator (12-gauge). This led to the 
premature termination of the study in the hospital using RSL as regular care. 
The radiologist experience was improved after a manufacturer modification of the 
needle-applicator. Surgical localization involved a low learning curve. Adverse 
events (n = 33) included dislocation of the marker during insertion (8%) and 
hematomas (9%). The majority of adverse events (85%) occurred using the 
first-generation needle-applicator.

non-wire localization of nonpalpable breast lesions.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10549-023-07006-x

cancer (CRC) with synchronous unresectable liver metastases (SULM) is at present 
undefined. It is not known if a palliative primary tumor resection followed by 
chemotherapy could have a survival benefit compared to upfront chemotherapy 
(CT). The aim of the study is to analyze the safety and effectiveness of both 
therapeutic strategies in a group of patients treated at one institution.
METHODS: A prospectively collected database was queried for patients affected by 
colorectal cancer with synchronous unresectable liver metastases between January 
2004 and December 2018, defining and comparing 2 groups: patients treated by 
chemotherapy alone (group 1) vs patients who underwent primary tumor resection 
with or without a first line chemotherapy (group 2). The primary end point was 
Overall Survival (OS), estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven patients were included: 52 in group 1 and 115 
in group 2, median follow-up 48 months (range 25-126). A difference of 14 months 
in overall survival was observed between group 2 compared to group 1 (28 vs 
14 months respectively; p < 0.001). Furthermore, overall survival increased in 
patients who underwent liver metastases resection (p < 0.001) or percutaneous 
radiofrequency ablation after surgery (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: With the limits of a retrospective analysis, the study shows that 
surgical resection of the primary tumor has a significant impact on survival 
compared to chemotherapy alone. Randomized controlled trials are needed to 
confirm these data.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

post-surgical follow-up since the surgical approach has a leading role in its 
treatment. The purpose of our study is to provide an overview of the typical and 
atypical MRI findings in a series of pediatric patients with isolated-not 
NF1-related-pilocytic astrocytomas and to correlate specific MRI patterns with 
clinical variables.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study providing the analysis of 
several clinical and neuroradiological findings from a cohort of pediatric 
pilocytic astrocytoma, starting from the data collected in the Fondazione IRCCS 
Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta (FINCB) internal Cancer Registry during an 
11-year time period (January 2008-January 2019).
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included in the study. Median age at diagnosis 
was 9.4 years; a slight female prevalence was noticed (m/f ratio 44.6%/55.4%). 
The majority of pPAs had well-defined contours: 51 (91.1%), 47 (88.7%) were 
hypointense on T1-wi, all of them were hyperintense on T2-wi, 46 (90.2%) were 
hyperintense on FLAIR, and 48 (85.7%) were heterogeneous on T1-wi and T2-wi 
sequences. We found positive correlation between pPAs location and age (r = 
0.017), and small degree of connection between pPAs location and gender 
(Cramer's V = 0.268).
CONCLUSIONS: We presented typical and atypical pPAs MRI findings. Age and tumor 
location were positevely correlated, while degree of connection between gender 
and pPAs location was small. All of this may aid clinicians, most of all 
neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, and neurologists in proper diagnoses and 
follow-up of these specific patient population.",© 2023. Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.,"DOI: 10.1007/s10072-023-06893-8

identification and treatment of the disease are essential to ensure the 
stability of the patients. Several existing skin cancer detection methods are 
introduced by employing deep learning (DL) to perform skin disease 
classification. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can classify melanoma skin 
cancer images. But, it suffers from an overfitting problem. Therefore, to 
overcome this problem and to classify both benign and malignant tumors 
efficiently, the multi-stage faster RCNN-based iSPLInception (MFRCNN-iSPLI) 
method is proposed. Then, the test dataset is used for evaluating the proposed 
model performance. The faster RCNN is employed directly to perform image 
classification. This may heavily raise computation time and network 
complications. So, the iSPLInception model is applied in the multi-stage 
classification. In this, the iSPLInception model is formulated using the 
Inception-ResNet design. For candidate box deletion, the prairie dog 
optimization algorithm is utilized. We have utilized two skin disease datasets, 
namely, ISIC 2019 Skin lesion image classification and the HAM10000 dataset for 
conducting experimental results. The methods' accuracy, precision, recall, and 
F1 score values are calculated, and the results are compared with the existing 
methods such as CNN, hybrid DL, Inception v3, and VGG19. With 95.82% accuracy, 
96.85% precision, 96.52% recall, and 0.95% F1 score values, the output analysis 
of each measure verified the prediction and classification effectiveness of the 
method.","© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Imaging Informatics

adverse health effects in exposed humans. Since foods AFs (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, 
AFG2) contamination in Sichuan Province are unexplored, we conducted a study to 
assess AFs exposure in the population. In total, 318 samples, including grains, 
red chilli, red chilli powder, and vegetable protein beverages, were collected 
from 13 cities of Sichuan Province, China, in 2022. AFs were detected in all 
types of foods except for wheat flour, the highest incidence was found in red 
chilli powder (75.0%). The concentrations of AFtot (the total aflatoxins) ranged 
between ND (not detected) and 54.20 μg kg-1. It was observed that the AFs 
profile was dominated by AFB1. The AFB1 content ranged from ND to 52.60 μg kg-1 
across food types. According to EU maximum limits (ML) of AFs, 2.8% of samples 
exceeded the AFtot limits. For AFB1, 0.4% and 4.3% of samples exceeded the China 
and EU limits, respectively. In this study, packaging types and sampling sites 
were selected as parameters influence food aflatoxin contamination. 
Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between different 
samples. According to exposure assessment and risk characterization, AFtot daily 
exposure was shown to be 0.263 and 283.936 ng kg-1 bw for the lower and upper 
exposure. The MOE value derived from consumption grains and red chilli pepper 
products were generally bellow 10 000, and liver cancer cases based on these two

(#)Contributed equally","Traditionally, the mouse has been the favoured vertebrate model for biomedical 
research, due to its experimental and genetic tractability. However, non-rodent 
embryological studies highlight that many aspects of early mouse development, 
such as its egg-cylinder gastrulation and method of implantation, diverge from 
other mammals, thus complicating inferences about human development. Like the 
human embryo, rabbits develop as a flat-bilaminar disc. Here we constructed a 
morphological and molecular atlas of rabbit development. We report 
transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiles for over 180,000 single 
cells and high-resolution histology sections from embryos spanning gastrulation, 
implantation, amniogenesis and early organogenesis. Using a neighbourhood 
comparison pipeline, we compare the transcriptional landscape of rabbit and 
mouse at the scale of the entire organism. We characterize the gene regulatory 
programmes underlying trophoblast differentiation and identify signalling 
interactions involving the yolk sac mesothelium during haematopoiesis. We 
demonstrate how the combination of both rabbit and mouse atlases can be 
leveraged to extract new biological insights from sparse macaque and human data.

broader cross-species approach to decipher early mammalian development, and are 
readily adaptable to deploy single-cell comparative genomics more broadly across

(#)Contributed equally","Proper repair of DNA damage lesions is essential to maintaining genome integrity 
and preventing the development of human diseases, including cancer. Increasing 
evidence suggests the importance of the nuclear envelope in the spatial 
regulation of DNA repair, although the mechanisms of such regulatory processes 
remain poorly defined. Through a genome-wide synthetic viability screen for 
PARP-inhibitor resistance using an inducible CRISPR-Cas9 platform and 
BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells, we identified a transmembrane nuclease 
(renamed NUMEN) that could facilitate compartmentalized and non-homologous end 
joining-dependent repair of double-stranded DNA breaks at the nuclear periphery. 
Collectively, our data demonstrate that NUMEN generates short 5' overhangs 
through its endonuclease and 3'→5' exonuclease activities, promotes the repair 
of DNA lesions-including heterochromatic lamina-associated domain breaks as well 
as deprotected telomeres-and functions as a downstream effector of DNA-dependent 
protein kinase catalytic subunit. These findings underline the role of NUMEN as 
a key player in DNA repair pathway choice and genome-stability maintenance, and 
have implications for ongoing research into the development and treatment of 
genome instability disorders.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41556-023-01165-1

prognostic score, modified Glasgow prognostic score and C-reactive protein to 
albumin ratio, were shown to be associated with prognosis in patients undergoing 
pancreatectomy for cancer. However, little is known about their predictive role 
in a Western population.
METHODS: The Norwegian National Registry for Gastrointestinal Surgery (NORGAST) 
was used to capture all pancreatectomies performed within the study period 
(November 2015-April 2021). The association between the preoperative 
inflammatory markers and postoperative outcomes was studied. Their impact on 
survival was examined in patients operated for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
RESULTS: A total of 1554 patients underwent pancreatectomy in this period. 
Glasgow prognostic score, modified Glasgow prognostic score and C-reactive 
protein to albumin ratio were associated with severe complications (Accordion 
grade ≥ III) in the univariable but not in the multivariable analysis. 
C-reactive protein to albumin ratio, but not Glasgow prognostic score and 
modified Glasgow prognostic score, was linked to survival following 
pancreatectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma. In the multivariable model, age, 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, ECOG score, C-reactive protein to albumin ratio and 
total pancreatectomy correlated with survival. Also, preoperative C-reactive 
protein to albumin ratio was significantly associated with survival after 
pancreatoduodenectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative Glasgow prognostic score, modified Glasgow prognostic 
score and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio have no role in predicting the 
complications after pancreatectomy. C-reactive protein to albumin ratio is a 
significant predictor for survival in ductal adenocarcinoma, yet its clinical 
relevance should be explored in conjunction with the pathology parameters and 
adjuvant therapy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s11605-023-05726-5

instability, which contributes to various human diseases. Identification of 
molecules and signaling pathways in controlling R-loop homeostasis provide 
important clues about their physiological and pathological roles in cells. Here, 
we show that NKAP (NF-κB activating protein) is essential for preventing R-loop 
accumulation and maintaining genome integrity through forming a protein complex 
with HDAC3. NKAP depletion causes DNA damage and genome instability. Aberrant 
accumulation of R-loops is present in NKAP-deficient cells and leads to DNA 
damage and DNA replication fork progression defects. Moreover, NKAP depletion 
induced R-loops and DNA damage are dependent on transcription. Consistently, the 
NKAP interacting protein HDAC3 exhibits a similar role in suppressing R-loop 
associated DNA damage and replication stress. Further analysis uncovers that 
HDAC3 functions to stabilize NKAP protein, independent of its deacetylase 
activity. In addition, NKAP prevents R-loop formation by maintaining RNA 
polymerase II pausing. Importantly, R-loops induced by NKAP or HDAC3 depletion 
are processed into DNA double-strand breaks by XPF and XPG endonucleases. These 
findings indicate that both NKAP and HDAC3 are novel key regulators of R-loop 
homeostasis, and their dysregulation might drive tumorigenesis by causing R-loop 
associated genome instability.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to ADMC Associazione

The expression of ZNF667-AS1, KIF5C, and miR-523-3p in CC cells and tissues was 
analyzed using RT-qPCR and western blotting. CCK-8 scratch-wound assay, western

experiments were also performed. CC cells and tissues showed low expression of 
NF667-AS1 and KIF5C and elevated expression of miR-523-3p. ZNF667-AS1 
overexpression attenuates proliferation and migration of CC cells, restores 
inactivated apoptosis in vitro, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. MiR-523-3p 
targets both ZNF667-AS1 and the KIF5C 3'UTR. ZNF667-AS1 overexpression in SW480

this attenuating effect was counteracted by KIF5C overexpression. ZNF667-AS1 
sequestered miR-523-3, reducing miR-523-3p-mediated inhibition of KIF5C

chemotherapy. Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are efficient in the treatment of heart 
failure and recently emerged in a new role in the treatment of cancer. 
ZINC253504760, a synthetic cardenolide that is structurally similar to 
well-known GCs, digitoxin and digoxin, has not been investigated yet. This study 
aims to investigate the cytotoxicity of ZINC253504760 on MDR cell lines and its 
molecular mode of action for cancer treatment. Four drug-resistant cell lines 
(P-glycoprotein-, ABCB5-, and EGFR-overexpressing cells, and TP53-knockout 
cells) did not show cross-resistance to ZINC253504760 except BCRP-overexpressing 
cells. Transcriptomic profiling indicated that cell death and survival as well 
as cell cycle (G2/M damage) were the top cellular functions affected by 
ZINC253504760 in CCRF-CEM cells, while CDK1 was linked with the downregulation 
of MEK and ERK. With flow cytometry, ZINC253504760 induced G2/M phase arrest. 
Interestingly, ZINC253504760 induced a novel state-of-the-art mode of cell death 
(parthanatos) through PARP and PAR overexpression as shown by western blotting, 
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation by immunofluorescence, DNA damage 
by comet assay, and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse by flow cytometry. 
These results were ROS-independent. Furthermore, ZINC253504760 is an 
ATP-competitive MEK inhibitor evidenced by its interaction with the MEK 
phosphorylation site as shown by molecular docking in silico and binding to 
recombinant MEK by microscale thermophoresis in vitro. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first time to describe a cardenolide that induces 
parthanatos in leukemia cells, which may help to improve efforts to overcome 
drug resistance in cancer. A cardiac glycoside compound ZINC253504760 displayed 
cytotoxicity against different multidrug-resistant cell lines. ZINC253504760 
exhibited cytotoxicity in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells by predominantly inducing a 
new mode of cell death (parthanatos). ZINC253504760 downregulated MEK1/2

Professionals about Reproductive Issues in Cancer Healthcare"" aims to help 
healthcare professionals communicate promptly with patients and survivors who 
are adolescents and young adults, with information pertinent to reproductive 
health issues such as the risk of infertility and fertility preservation.
METHODS: The study participants were professional healthcare providers, 
including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, midwives, 
psychologists, laboratory technicians, genetic counselors, and dieticians. Pre- 
and post- and 3-month follow-up tests consisting of 41 questions were 
administered to measure changes in knowledge and confidence. The participants 
also received a follow-up survey that covered confidence, communication 
techniques, and practice habits. A total of 820 healthcare providers 
participated in this program.
RESULTS: The mean total score from the pre-test to the post-test grew 
significantly (p < 0.01), and participants' self-confidence increased. In 
addition, there was a change in the behavior of healthcare providers, who began 
asking about patients' marital status and parity.
CONCLUSION: Our web-based fertility preservation training program improved 
knowledge and self-confidence regarding fertility preservation issues among 
healthcare providers caring for adolescents and young adult cancer patients and 
survivors.","© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Society of Clinical

colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment. Reports regarding other multikinase 
inhibitors have suggested that the development of hypertension is associated 
with improved clinical benefits. We aimed to reveal the relationship between the 
development of severe hypertension and regorafenib efficacy in an mCRC 
real-world setting.
METHODS: Patients with mCRC (n = 100) who received regorafenib were assessed 
retrospectively. The primary endpoint was a comparison of progression-free 
survival (PFS) between patients with and without ≥ grade 3 hypertension. The 
secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and 
adverse effects.
RESULTS: Patients developing ≥ grade 3 hypertension accounted for 30%, and 
obtained significantly longer PFS than control patients (median PFS of 53 and 
56 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 46-144 and 49-63 days, respectively; 
P = 0.04). In contrast, OS and DCR were not statistically different between the 
groups (P = 0.13 and P = 0.46, respectively). The incidence and severity of 
adverse effects were not significantly different, except for hypertension. 
Treatment interruption was significantly more frequent in patients with 
hypertension (P = 0.04). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis suggested that the 
development of ≥ grade 3 severe hypertension was an independent factor for 
improved PFS (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.93; P = 0.02). In 
contrast, baseline hypoalbuminemia was associated with a worse PFS (1.85, 
1.14-3.01; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: We have revealed that patients who develop severe hypertension after 
regorafenib treatment for mCRC have improved PFS. Management of hypertension is 
important for effective treatment with less burden; therefore, further 
evaluation is needed.","© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Society of Clinical

results in complete and specific loss of Sall1 expression in microglia. By 
determining the genomic binding sites of SALL1 and leveraging Sall1 enhancer 
knockout mice, we provide evidence for functional interactions between SALL1 and

the Sall1 super-enhancer and is required for Sall1 expression, consistent with 
an evolutionarily conserved requirement of the TGFβ and SMAD homologs Dpp and 
Mad for cell-specific expression of Spalt in the Drosophila wing. Unexpectedly, 
SALL1 in turn promotes binding and function of SMAD4 at microglia-specific 
enhancers while simultaneously suppressing binding of SMAD4 to enhancers of 
genes that become inappropriately activated in enhancer knockout microglia,

life-threatening complication in patients treated with rituximab. However, there 
is no consensus on the primary prophylaxis for it in rituximab-treated pemphigus 
patients. Therefore, we sought to investigate the prophylactic efficacy and 
safety profile of cotrimoxazole for reducing the risk of developing PJP in 
pemphigus patients receiving rituximab.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study investigated 148 pemphigus 
patients undergoing a first cycle of rituximab between 2008 and 2021 at a 
tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan. Patients were divided into the 
prophylaxis group (N = 113) and the control group (N = 35) according to whether 
or not cotrimoxazole was administered. The primary outcome was the 1-year 
incidence of PJP in the two groups, while the secondary outcome was the 
incidence of cotrimoxazole-related adverse events.
RESULTS: Of the 148 patients enrolled in this study, three patients, all in the 
control group, developed PJP during the 1-year follow-up. The incidence of PJP 
(8.6%) in the control group was significantly higher than that in the 
prophylaxis group (0%) (p = 0.012). The incidence of cotrimoxazole-related 
adverse events was 2.7%, and none of the cases were associated with 
life-threatening conditions. In addition, the cumulative prednisolone dose was 
associated with a trend of a higher risk of PJP (p = 0.0483).
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic cotrimoxazole significantly reduces the risk of PJP in 
a certain high-risk population and has a tolerable safety profile.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s13555-023-00953-9

sporadic information has revealed that glycolytic metabolites possess

Here, we introduce a target-responsive accessibility profiling (TRAP) approach 
that measures changes in ligand binding-induced accessibility for target 
identification by globally labeling reactive proteinaceous lysines. With TRAP, 
we mapped 913 responsive target candidates and 2,487 interactions for 10 major

by TRAP unveils diverse regulatory modalities of glycolytic metabolites, and 
these modalities involve direct perturbation of enzymes in carbohydrate 
metabolism, intervention of an orphan transcriptional protein's activity and 
modulation of targetome-level acetylation. These results further our knowledge

aspirin for colorectal cancer (CRC) shows conflicting results. We aimed to 
emulate a trial of aspirin intiation in individuals with incident polyps.
METHODS: We identified individuals registered with their first colorectal polyp 
in the nationwide gastrointestinal ESPRESSO histopathology cohort in Sweden. 
Individuals aged 45-79 years diagnosed with colorectal polyps 2006-2016 in 
Sweden without CRC or contraindications for preventive aspirin (cerebrovascular 
disease, heart failure, aortic aneurysms, pulmonary emboli, myocardial 
infarction, gastric ulcer, dementia, liver cirrhosis, or any other metastatic 
cancer) registered until the month of first polyp detection were eligible. Using 
duplication and inverse probability weighting, we emulated a target trial of 
aspirin initiation within 2 years of initial polyp detection. The main outcome 
measures were incident CRC, CRC mortality and all-cause mortality registered 
until 2019.
RESULTS: Of 31,633 individuals meeting our inclusion criteria, 1716 (5%) 
initiated aspirin within 2 years of colon polyp diagnosis. Median follow-up was 
8.07 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence in initiators versus non-initiators 
was 6% versus 8% for CRC incidence, 1% versus 1% for CRC mortality and 21% 
versus 18% for all-cause mortality. The corresponding hazard ratios were 0.88 
(95% confidence interval, 95%CI = 0.86-0.90), 0.90 (95%CI = 0.75-1.06) and 1.18 
(95%CI = 1.12-1.24).
CONCLUSION: Aspirin initiation in individuals with polyp removal was linked to 
2% lower cumulative incidence of CRC after 10 years but did not alter CRC 
mortality. We also observed a 4% increased risk difference of all-cause 
mortality at 10 years after the initiation of aspirin.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10654-023-01024-1

watershed moment in the legal recognition of enforceable rights to informational 
self-determination. The rapid evolution of legal requirements applicable to data 
use, however, has the potential to outstrip the capabilities of networks of 
biomedical data users to respond to the shifting norms. It can also delegitimate 
established institutional bodies that are responsible for assessing and 
authorising the downstream use of data, including research ethics committees and 
institutional data custodians. These burdens are especially pronounced for 
clinical and research networks that are of transnational scale, because the 
legal compliance burden for outbound international data transfers from the EEA 
is especially high. Legislatures, courts, and regulators in the EU should 
therefore implement the following three legal changes. First, the 
responsibilities of particular actors in a data sharing network should be 
delimited through the contractual allocation of responsibilities between 
collaborators. Second, the use of data through secure data processing 
environments should not trigger the international transfer provisions of the 
GDPR. Third, the use of federated data analysis methodologies that do not 
provide analysis nodes or downstream users access to identifiable personal data 
as part of the outputs of those analyses should not be considered circumstances 
of joint controllership, nor lead to the users of non-identifiable data to be 
considered controllers or processors. These small clarifications of, or 
modifications to, the GDPR would facilitate the exchange of biomedical data 
amongst clinicians and researchers.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41431-023-01403-y

improve, long-term health outcomes increasingly define quality of care. The 
International Childhood Cancer Outcome Project developed a set of core outcomes 
for most types of childhood cancers involving relevant international 
stakeholders (survivors; pediatric oncologists; other medical, nursing or 
paramedical care providers; and psychosocial or neurocognitive care providers) 
to allow outcome-based evaluation of childhood cancer care. A survey among 
healthcare providers (n = 87) and online focus groups of survivors (n = 22) 
resulted in unique candidate outcome lists for 17 types of childhood cancer 
(five hematological malignancies, four central nervous system tumors and eight 
solid tumors). In a two-round Delphi survey, 435 healthcare providers from 68 
institutions internationally (response rates for round 1, 70-97%; round 2, 
65-92%) contributed to the selection of four to eight physical core outcomes 
(for example, heart failure, subfertility and subsequent neoplasms) and three 
aspects of quality of life (physical, psychosocial and neurocognitive) per 
pediatric cancer subtype. Measurement instruments for the core outcomes consist 
of medical record abstraction, questionnaires and linkage with existing 
registries. This International Childhood Cancer Core Outcome Set represents 
outcomes of value to patients, survivors and healthcare providers and can be 
used to measure institutional progress and benchmark against peers.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","DOI: 10.1038/s41591-023-02339-y

subset of T cell rich tumors fail to respond to immune checkpoint blockade 
(ICB). We leveraged a neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 trial in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as additional samples collected from 
patients treated off-label, to explore correlates of response to ICB within T 
cell-rich tumors. We show that ICB response correlated with the clonal expansion 
of intratumoral CXCL13+CH25H+IL-21+PD-1+CD4+ T helper cells (""CXCL13+ TH"") and 
Granzyme K+ PD-1+ effector-like CD8+ T cells, whereas terminally exhausted 
CD39hiTOXhiPD-1hiCD8+ T cells dominated in nonresponders. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
clones that expanded post-treatment were found in pretreatment biopsies. 
Notably, PD-1+TCF-1+ (Progenitor-exhausted) CD8+ T cells shared clones mainly 
with effector-like cells in responders or terminally exhausted cells in 
nonresponders, suggesting that local CD8+ T cell differentiation occurs upon 
ICB. We found that these Progenitor CD8+ T cells interact with CXCL13+ TH within 
cellular triads around dendritic cells enriched in maturation and regulatory 
molecules, or ""mregDC"". These results suggest that discrete intratumoral niches 
that include mregDC and CXCL13+ TH control the differentiation of tumor-specific

environment is important. In this regard, the risk assessment of PAHs in 
borehole water near the unlined dumpsite in Anambra State was investigated. 
Samples of borehole water (16 each) were collected from the study and control 
areas during both seasons. The PAH concentrations in the borehole water samples 
were analyzed using gas chromatography. The mean PAH concentration in the study 
and control samples for the wet season varied from BL-7.65 µg/L to BL-2.98 µg/L, 
respectively. The study samples' dry season values ranged from BL to 3.33 µg/L, 
while control samples ranged from BL to 1.87 µg/L. [Formula: see text]PAHs for 
the wet and dry seasons varied from 5.8 to 13.94 µg/L and 4.25 to 10.09 µg/L for 
study and control samples, respectively. The four and five rings PAH were the 
most dominant group in the [Formula: see text] PAHs for the study and control 
samples, respectively. Diagnostic ratios suggested pyrolytic and petrogenic 
sources for both locations. The cluster analysis showed different sources of the 
congeners in the samples. The non-carcinogenic risk showed no possibility of 
risks via dermal and ingestion routes. In addition, the possibility of cancer 
risks via ingestion routes was doubtful. The carcinogenic risk index through 
dermal contact exceeded the acceptable limit for adults and is at a tolerable 
limit for children, indicating potential threats to humans, with adults more 
susceptible to cancer risks. Therefore, this study recommends that sanitary

(LMICs) with limited vital surveillance. Here we unravel the contributions of 
probable COVID-19 deaths from other changes in mortality related to pandemic 
control measures using medically-certified death registrations from Madurai, 
India-an urban center with well-functioning vital surveillance. Between March, 
2020 and July, 2021, all-cause deaths in Madurai exceeded expected levels by 30% 
(95% confidence interval: 27-33%). Although driven by deaths attributed to 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions, diabetes, senility, and other 
uncategorized causes, increases in these attributions were restricted to 
medically-unsupervised deaths, and aligned with surges in confirmed or 
attributed COVID-19 mortality, likely reflecting mortality among unconfirmed 
COVID-19 cases. Implementation of lockdown measures was associated with a 7% 
(0-13%) reduction in all-cause mortality, driven by reductions in deaths 
attributed to injuries, infectious diseases and maternal conditions, and 
cirrhosis and other liver conditions, respectively, but offset by a doubling in 
cancer deaths. Our findings help to account for gaps between documented COVID-19 
mortality and excess all-cause mortality during the pandemic in an LMIC setting.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-39322-7

neoplasms. They are characterized by nuclear atypia, high mitotic rate and 
cellular polymorphism that often contributes to aggressiveness and resistance to 
standard therapy. They often associate with challenging treatment approaches and 
poor outcomes. New treatment strategies or regimens to improve the efficacy of 
glioma treatment require a deeper understanding of glioma occurrence and 
development as well as elucidation of their molecular biological 
characteristics. Recent studies have revealed RNA modifications as a key 
regulatory mechanism involved in tumorigenesis, tumor progression, immune 
regulation, and response to therapy. The present review discusses research 
advances on several RNA modifications involved in glioma progression and tumor 
microenvironment (TME) immunoregulation as well as in the development of 
adaptive drug resistance, summarizing current progress on major RNA modification

into a spiral staircase, ring-like hexamer, encircling dsDNA. Four protomers of 
RuvB contact the DNA backbone with a translocation step size of 2 nucleotides. 
The variation of nucleotide-binding states in RuvB supports a sequential model 
for ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide recycling, which occur at separate, singular 
positions. RuvB's asymmetric assembly also explains the 6:4 stoichiometry 
between the RuvB/RuvA complex, which coordinates HJ migration in bacteria. Taken 
together, we provide a mechanistic understanding of HJ branch migration

to its claimed antioxidant properties, racemic (R/S)-lipoic acid is used as a

is an approved drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. However, its

molecular targets of the reduced form of lipoic acid and lipoamide. Importantly, 
only the naturally occurring (R)-enantiomer inhibits HDACs at physiologically 
relevant concentrations and leads to hyperacetylation of HDAC substrates. The 
inhibition of HDACs by (R)-lipoic acid and lipoamide explain why both compounds 
prevent stress granule formation in cells and may also provide a molecular

various cancer types and is a potential target for cancer therapy. However, 
whether it provides a functional role in tumor progression remains unclear. 
Here, quantitative proteomics reveals that cancer cells under starvation stress 
express higher eATP synthase and enhance the production of extracellular 
vesicles (EVs), which are vital regulators within the tumor microenvironment. 
Further results show that eATP synthase generates extracellular ATP to stimulate 
EV secretion by enhancing P2X7 receptor-triggered Ca2+ influx. Surprisingly, 
eATP synthase is also located on the surface of tumor-secreted EVs. The 
EVs-surface eATP synthase increases the uptake of tumor-secreted EVs in Jurkat 
T-cells via association with Fyn, a plasma membrane protein found in immune 
cells. The eATP synthase-coated EVs uptake subsequently represses the 
proliferation and cytokine secretion of Jurkat T-cells. This study clarifies the

diagnosis techniques, often diagnosed at an advanced stage when effective 
treatment is no longer possible. Therefore, automated systems that can detect 
cancer early are crucial to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes. In the 
medical field, several algorithms have been put into use. Valid and 
interpretable data are essential for effective diagnosis and therapy. There is 
much room for cutting-edge computer systems to develop. The main objective of 
this research is to predict pancreatic cancer early using deep learning and 
metaheuristic techniques. This research aims to create a deep learning and 
metaheuristic techniques-based system to predict pancreatic cancer early by 
analyzing medical imaging data, mainly CT scans, and identifying vital features 
and cancerous growths in the pancreas using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
and YOLO model-based CNN (YCNN) models. Once diagnosed, the disease cannot be 
effectively treated, and its progression is unpredictable. That's why there's 
been a push in recent years to implement fully automated systems that can sense 
cancer at a prior stage and improve diagnosis and treatment. The paper aims to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the novel YCNN approach compared to other modern 
methods in predicting pancreatic cancer. To predict the vital features from the 
CT scan and the proportion of cancer feasts in the pancreas using the threshold 
parameters booked as markers. This paper employs a deep learning approach called 
a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) model to predict pancreatic cancer images. 
In addition, we use the YOLO model-based CNN (YCNN) to aid in the categorization 
process. Both biomarkers and CT image dataset is used for testing. The YCNN 
method was shown to perform well by a cent percent of accuracy compared to other 
modern techniques in a thorough review of comparative findings.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36886-8

we constructed a risk score model using LASSO Cox regression analysis, and 
verified whether the risk score can predict the survival of LUAD patients 
independent of other factors. Moreover, we explored the immune infiltration of 
22 immune cells between high-risk and low-risk patients. Totally 10 
drug-resistance positively related genes (PLEK2, TFAP2A, KIF20A, S100P, GDF15, 
HSPB8, SASH1, WASF3, LAMA3 and TCN1) were identified in LUAD. The risk score 
model of LUAD constructed with these 10 genes could reliably predict the 
prognosis of LUAD patients. 18 pathways were significantly activated in 
high-risk group compared with low-risk group. In addition, the infiltration 
proportion of multiple immune cells was significantly different between 
high-risk and low-risk groups, and the proportion of M1 phagocytes was 
significantly higher in the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group. 
The drug resistance related genes (PLEK2, TFAP2A, KIF20A, S100P, GDF15, HSPB8, 
SASH1, WASF3, LAMA3 and TCN1) could predict the prognosis of LUAD patients. 
Clarifying the roles and mechanisms of these 10 genes in regulating drug 
resistance in LUAD will help to improve individualized clinical treatment 
protocols and predict patient sensitivity to treatment.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-35743-y

complex signal transduction events. Particularly, the underlying mechanisms that 
bridge extracellular stimuli to the molecular machinery driving motility remain 
partially understood. Here, we show that the scaffold protein CNK2 promotes 
cancer cell migration by coupling the pro-metastatic receptor tyrosine kinase 
AXL to downstream activation of ARF6 GTPase. Mechanistically, AXL signalling 
induces PI3K-dependent recruitment of CNK2 to the plasma membrane. In turn, CNK2 
stimulates ARF6 by associating with cytohesin ARF GEFs and with a novel adaptor 
protein called SAMD12. ARF6-GTP then controls motile forces by coordinating the 
respective activation and inhibition of RAC1 and RHOA GTPases. Significantly, 
genetic ablation of CNK2 or SAMD12 reduces metastasis in a mouse xenograft 
model. Together, this work identifies CNK2 and its partner SAMD12 as key 
components of a novel pro-motility pathway in cancer cells, which could be 
targeted in metastasis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-39281-z

cancer. Pesticides are of interest in etiologic studies of breast cancer because 
many pesticides mimic estrogen, a known breast cancer risk factor. In this 
study, we discerned the toxic role of the pesticides atrazine, dichlorvos, and 
endosulfan in inducing breast cancer. Various experimental studies, such as 
biochemical profiling of pesticide-exposed blood samples, comet assays, 
karyotyping analysis, pesticide and DNA interaction analysis by molecular 
docking, DNA cleavage, and cell viability assays, have been carried out. 
Biochemical profiling showed an increased level of blood sugar, WBC, hemoglobin, 
and blood urea in the patient exposed to pesticides for more than 15 years. The 
comet assay for DNA damage performed on patients exposed to pesticides and 
pesticide-treated blood samples revealed more DNA damage at the 50 ng 
concentration of all three pesticides. Karyotyping analysis showed enlargements 
in the heterochromatin region and 14pstk+, and 15pstk+in the exposed groups. In 
molecular docking analysis, atrazine had the highest glide score (- 5.936) and 
glide energy (- 28.690), which reveals relatively high binding capability with 
the DNA duplex. The DNA cleavage activity results showed that atrazine caused 
higher DNA cleavage than the other two pesticides. Cell viability was the lowest 
at 50 ng/ml (72 h). Statistical analysis performed using SPSS software unveiled 
a positive correlation (< 0.05) between pesticide exposure and breast cancer.

survival rate less than 5%. The abnormal proliferation and distant metastasis 
are major obstacles for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, 
therefore, it is urgent for researchers to uncover the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the PC proliferation and metastasis. In current study, we found that 
USP33, a member of deubiquitinating enzyme family, was upregulated among PC 
samples and cells, meanwhile, the high expression of USP33 correlated with poor 
prognosis of patients. Function experiments revealed that USP33 overexpression 
promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of PC cells while the 
inhibition of USP33 expression in PC cells exhibited the opposite effect. The 
mass spectrum and luciferase complementation assay screened TGFBR2 as the 
potential binding protein of USP33. Mechanistically, USP33 triggered the 
deubiquitination of TGFBR2 and prevented its degradation by lysosome, therefore 
promoted TGFBR2 accumulation in cell membrane and eventually contributed to the 
sustained activation of TGF-β signaling. Moreover, our results revealed that the 
activation of TGF-β targeted gene ZEB1 promoted the transcription of USP33. In 
conclusion, our study found that USP33 contributed to the proliferation and 
metastasis of pancreatic cancer through a positive feedback loop with TGF-β 
signaling pathway. Moreover, this study suggested that USP33 may serve as a 
potential prognostic and therapeutic target in PC.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41419-023-05871-4

lymphoma in which the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges and/or eyes are 
exclusive sites of disease. Pathophysiology is incompletely understood, although 
a central role seems to comprise immunoglobulins binding to self-proteins 
expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and alterations of genes involved 
in B cell receptor, Toll-like receptor and NF-κB signalling. Other factors such 
as T cells, macrophages or microglia, endothelial cells, chemokines, and 
interleukins, probably also have important roles. Clinical presentation varies 
depending on the involved regions of the CNS. Standard of care includes 
methotrexate-based polychemotherapy followed by age-tailored thiotepa-based 
conditioned autologous stem cell transplantation and, in patients unsuitable for 
such treatment, consolidation with whole-brain radiotherapy or single-drug 
maintenance. Personalized treatment, primary radiotherapy and only supportive 
care should be considered in unfit, frail patients. Despite available 
treatments, 15-25% of patients do not respond to chemotherapy and 25-50% relapse 
after initial response. Relapse rates are higher in older patients, although the 
prognosis of patients experiencing relapse is poor independent of age. Further

coumarins compounds were screened in human cancer cell lines (HEPG-2, MCF-7, 
HCT-116 and PC-3) to learn about their cytotoxic effects in addition to the 
study of their DNA damage and antioxidant activity. Three of these compounds 
exhibited remarkable antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities. Moreover, 
they have the capability to protect DNA from damage induced by bleomycin.

the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is an important mechanism by which 
prostate cancer reaches castration resistance. At the start of this pathway is a 
branch point at which DHEA can be converted to Δ4 -androstenedione by the enzyme 
3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD) or to Δ5 -androstenediol by 17βHSD. To 
better understand this process, we studied the kinetics of these reactions in 
cells.
METHODS: Prostate cancer cells (LNCaP cell line) were incubated with steroids 
(DHEA and Δ5 -androstenediol) over a range of concentrations and the steroid 
metabolism reaction products were measured by mass spectrometry or by 
high-performance liquid chromatography to determine reaction kinetics. To 
confirm the generalizability of results, experiments were also performed in 
JEG-3 placental choriocarcinoma cells.
RESULTS: The two reactions displayed very different saturation profiles, with 
only the 3βHSD-catalyzed reaction beginning to saturate within a physiological 
substrate concentration range. Strikingly, incubating LNCaP cells with low (in 
the ~10 nM range) concentrations of DHEA resulted in a large majority of the 
DHEA undergoing 3βHSD-catalyzed conversion to Δ4 -androstenedione, whereas high 
concentrations of DHEA (in the 100s of nM range) resulted in most of the DHEA 
undergoing 17βHSD-catalyzed conversion to Δ5 -androstenediol.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to expectations from previous studies that used purified 
enzyme, cellular metabolism of DHEA by 3βHSD begins to saturate in the 
physiological concentration range, suggesting that fluctuations in DHEA 
concentrations could be buffered at the downstream active androgen level.",© 2023 The Authors. The Prostate published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/pros.24587

in the United States, where the annual cost of cancer care is estimated to reach 
$246 billion in 2030. As a result, cancer centers are considering moving away 
from fee-for-service models and transitioning to value-based care models, 
including value-based frameworks (VBFs), clinical care pathways (CCPs), and 
alternative payment models (APMs). OBJECTIVE: To assess the barriers and 
motivations for using value-based care models from the perspectives of 
physicians and quality officers (QOs) at US cancer centers. METHODS: Sites were 
recruited from cancer centers in the Midwest, Northeast, South, and West regions 
in a 15/15/20/10 relative distribution. Cancer centers were identified based on 
prior research relationships and known participation in the Oncology Care Model 
or other APMs. Based on a literature search, multiple choice and open-ended 
questions were developed for the survey. A link to the survey was emailed to 
hematologists/oncologists and QOs at academic and community cancer centers from 
August to November 2020. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics. 
RESULTS: A total of 136 sites were contacted; 28 (21%) centers returned 
completed surveys, which were included in the final analysis. 45 surveys (23 
from community centers, 22 from academic centers) were completed: 59% (26/44), 
76% (34/45), and 67% (30/45) of physicians/QOs respondents had used or 
implemented a VBF, CCP, and APM, respectively. The top motivator for VBF use was 
""producing real-world data for providers, payers, and patients"" (50% [13/26]). 
Among those not using CCPs, the most common barrier was a ""lack of consensus on 
pathway choices"" (64% [7/11]). For APMs, the most common difficulty was that 
""innovations in health care services and therapies must be adopted at the site's 
own financial risk"" (27% [8/30]). CONCLUSIONS: The ability to measure 
improvements in cancer health outcomes was a large motivator for implementing 
value-based models. However, heterogeneity in practice size, limited resources, 
and potential increase in costs were possible barriers to implementation. Payers 
need to be willing to negotiate with cancer centers and providers to implement 
the payment model that will most benefit patients. The future integration of 
VBFs, CCPs, and APMs will depend on reducing the complexity and burden of 
implementation. DISCLOSURES :Dr Panchal was affiliated with the University of

leading causes of cancer mortality. Emerging evidence supports that aberrant 
expression of lncRNAs is correlated with tumor progression and various aspects 
of tumor development.
AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the expression pattern of LINC01116 in breast 
cancer tissues and investigate the impact of LINC01116 on patients' survival.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Microarray and qRT-PCR data analysis were performed, and 
the KM-plotter database was used in this study. In addition, the gain of 
function approach was performed to examine the effect of LINC01116 on breast 
cancer cells in-vitro. The results exhibited that LINC01116 is meaningfully 
upregulated in the ER+ tumor specimens compared to the ER- ones. Also, relative 
to normal tissues, the expression of LINC01116 in ER+ and ER- tumor tissues 
significantly increased and decreased, respectively. ROC curve analysis revealed 
the power of LINC01116 in distinguishing ER+ from ER- samples. Additionally, the 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the LINC01116 expression positively 
correlates with survival probability in all as well as ER+ patients. However, 
this correlation was negative in ER- patients. Furthermore, our results showed 
that the overexpression of LINC01116 induces TGF-β signaling in ER- cells 
(MDA-MB-231), and microarray data analysis revealed that LINC01116 is 
significantly upregulated in 17β-Estradiol treated MCF7 cells.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results suggest that LINC01116 can be a potential 
biomarker in distinguishing ER+ and ER- tissues and has different effects on

cancer is widely recognized, little is known about the risk of developing 
hypertension in patients with a history of cancer.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study analyzed data from the 
JMDC Claims Database between 2005 and 2022, including 78,162 patients with a 
history of cancer and 3,692,654 individuals without cancer. The primary endpoint 
was the incidence of hypertension.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 1,208 ± 966 days, 311,197 
participants developed hypertension. The incidence of hypertension was 364.6 
(95% CI 357.0-372.2) per 10000 person-years among those with a history of 
cancer, and 247.2 (95% CI 246.3-248.1) per 10000 person-years in those without 
cancer. Individuals with a history of cancer had an elevated risk of developing 
hypertension according to multivariable Cox regression analyses (HR 1.17, 95% CI 
1.15-1.20). Both cancer patients requiring active antineoplastic therapy (HR 
2.01, 95% CI 1.85-2.20), and those who did not require active antineoplastic 
therapy (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.12-1.17) had an increased risk of hypertension. A 
multitude of sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the relationship 
between cancer and incident hypertension. Patients with certain types of cancer 
were found to have a higher risk of developing hypertension than those without 
cancer, with varying risks dependent on the type of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of a nationwide epidemiological database revealed that 
individuals with a history of cancer have a higher risk of developing 
hypertension, and that this finding applies to both cancer patients who require 
active antineoplastic therapy and those who do not.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributing to 
establish and validate radiomics-based nomograms for predicting the different 
pathological outcome of breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
(NAC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively collected 387 patients with locally 
advanced breast cancer, all treated with NAC and received breast dynamic 
contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) before NAC. Radiomics signatures were extracted 
from region of interest (ROI) on multiparametric MRI to build rad score. 
Clinical-pathologic data and radiological features established the clinical 
model. The comprehensive model featured rad-score, predictive 
clinical-pathologic data and radiological features, which was ultimately 
displayed as a nomogram. Patients were grouped in 2 different ways in accordance 
with the Miller-Payne (MP) grading of surgical specimens. The first grouping 
method: 181 patients with pathological reaction grades Ⅳ∼Ⅴ were included in the 
significant remission group, while 206 patients with pathological reaction 
grades Ⅰ∼Ⅲ were included in the nonsignificant remission group. The second 
grouping method: 117 patients with pathological complete response (pCR) were 
assigned to the pCR group, and 270 patients who failed to meet pCR were assigned 
to in the non-pCR group. Two combined nomograms are created from 2 grouped data 
for predicting different pathological responses to NAC. The area under the 
curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to 
evaluate the performance of each model. While decision curve analysis (DCA) and 
calibration curves were used for estimating the clinical application value of 
the nomogram.
RESULTS: Two combined nomograms embodying rad score and clinical-pathologic data 
outperformed, showing good calibrations for predicting response to NAC. The 
combined nomogram predicting pCR showed the best performance with the AUC values 
of 0.97, 0.90 and 0.86 in the training, testing, and external validation cohorts 
respectively. The AUC values of another combined nomogram predicting significant 
remission: 0.98, 0.88 0.80 in the training, testing and external validation 
cohorts. DCA showed the comprehensive model nomogram obtained the most clinical 
benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined nomogram could preoperatively predict significant 
remission or even pCR to NAC in breast cancer based on multiparametric MRI and 
clinical-pathologic data.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2023.05.010

Context- and concentration-dependent biological effects are the hallmarks of the 
pleiotropic role of IL-10. Despite reducing tumor-promoting inflammation, IL-10 
may have a role in rejuvenating exhausted tumor-resident T cells. Contrary to 
the assumption that IL-10 produces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment 
(TME), it promotes activation of tumor-resident CD8+ T cells, which aids tumor 
rejection. Emerging data from published early-Phase trials have shown mixed

chemo-preventative effects of aspirin on breast cancer have been demonstrated in 
several longitudinal studies however previous meta-analysis have shown 
inconsistent results. This study aimed to assess the relationship between 
aspirin use and BC risk, and to determine if there is a dose-response 
relationship between aspirin and BC risk. Studies incorporating BC risk with 
aspirin use published within the last twenty years were included. The study 
report is based on the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology. Twenty-eight cohort studies that reported BC incidence during a 
follow up of 4.4-32 years were included. Compared to non-users, aspirin users 
had a reduced risk of BC (HR = 0.91, c.i 0.81-0.97, p = 0.002). There was no 
obvious association between BC risk reduction and aspirin dose (HR = 0.94, c.i 
0.85-1.04) or duration (HR = 0.86, c.i 0.71-1.03). Frequency, however, was 
associated with a reduced risk of BC (HR = 0.90, c.i 0.82-0.98). A risk 
reduction was observed in oestrogen receptor (ER) positive tumours (HR = 0.90, 
c.i 0.86-0.96, p = 0.0004) while no relationship was observed with ER negative 
tumours (HR = 0.94, c.i 0.85-1.05). This meta-analysis found an association 
between aspirin intake and BC risk reduction. A more favourable outcome was 
noted with ingestion of greater than 6 tablets of aspirin per week. Aspirin had 
a significant risk reduction in patients with ER positive tumours compared to ER 
negative BC.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejso.2023.05.015

inception cohort of 576 isolated T3-4M0 endolaryngeal SCC candidates for TL 
consecutively managed between 1970 and 2019 in a French university teaching 
hospital. The main endpoint was survival time and cause of death in 2 groups. 
Group A, 4.5% of the cohort, consisted of 26 patients who declined any laryngeal 
treatment. Group B consisted of 550 patients who accepted TL. Accessory 
endpoints were causes of TL refusal and associated variables. The STROBE 
guideline was applied. The significance threshold was set at P<0.005.
RESULTS: One-and 3-year actuarial survival estimates increased significantly 
(P<0.0001) from 39% and 15% in group A, to 83% and 63% in group B, respectively. 
In group A, 92% of causes of death implicated index SCC progression, whereas in 
group B intercurrent disease, metachronous second primary, locoregional and/or 
metastatic SCC progression and postoperative complications accounted for 37%, 
31%, 29%, and 2%, respectively. The actuarial survival estimates within group A 
increased significantly (P=0.0003) from 0% at 1-year in patients managed with 
isolated supportive care to 56% in patients managed with chemotherapy (reaching 
0% at 5years). Reasons for TL refusal were fear of surgery, refusal of 
tracheostoma, loss of physiologic phonation, and certain comorbidities. Age and 
chronologic period correlated significantly with TL refusal. Median age 
decreased (P<0.001) from 69years in group A to 58 years in group B. Percentage 
TL refusal increased (P<0.0001) from 2% to 11% before and after start 1990, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The current study determined loss of survival with refusal of any 
laryngeal treatment including TL, noted benefit of chemotherapy associated to 
supportive care, and discussed the possible contribution of immunotherapy.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.anorl.2023.06.001

cancer (BC). Vitamin D is involved in various biological functions which have 
the potential to prevent BC development. Besides, vitamin D also influences the 
uptake of calcium and phosphorus, thereby possibly indirectly influencing the 
risk of BC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between 
vitamin D intake and BC risk.
METHODS: Individual dietary data were pooled from ten cohort studies. Food item 
intake was converted to daily intakes of vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus. 
Pooled multivariate hazard ratios (HRs), with corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were obtained using Cox-regression models. Analyses were 
adjusted for gender, age and smoking status (Model 1), and additionally for the 
food groups fruit, vegetables and meat (Model 2). Dose-response relationships 
(Model 1) were examined using a nonparametric test for trend.
RESULTS: In total, 1994 cases and 518,002 non-cases were included in the 
analyses. The present study showed no significant associations between 
individual nutrient intake and BC risk. A significant decreased BC risk was 
observed for high vitamin D intake with moderate calcium and low phosphorus 
intake (Model 2: HRhigh vitD, mod Ca, low P: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.59-1.00). No 
significant dose-response analyses were observed.
CONCLUSION: The present study showed a decreased BC risk for high dietary 
vitamin D intake in combination with low calcium intake and moderate phosphorus 
intake. The study highlights the importance of examining the effect of a 
nutrient in combination with complementary nutrients for risk assessment. Future 
research should focus on nutrients in a wider context and in nutritional 
patterns.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clnu.2023.05.010

(PMRT) among women with early invasive breast cancer (EIBC) varied within 
England and Wales and explored the role of different patient factors in 
explaining any variation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used national cancer data on women aged ≥50 
years diagnosed with EIBC (stage I-IIIa) in England and Wales between January 
2014 and December 2018 who had a mastectomy within 12 months of diagnosis. A 
multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to calculate 
risk-adjusted rates of PMRT for geographical regions and National Health Service 
acute care organisations. The study examined the variation in these rates within 
subgroups of women with different risks of recurrence (low: T1-2N0; 
intermediate: T3N0/T1-2N1; high: T1-2N2/T3N1-2) and investigated whether the 
variation was linked to patient case-mix within regions and organisations.
RESULTS: Among 26 228 women, use of PMRT increased with greater recurrence risk 
(low: 15.0%; intermediate: 59.4%; high: 85.1%). In all risk groups, use of PMRT 
was more common among women who had received chemotherapy and decreased among 
women aged ≥80 years. There was weak or no evidence of an association between 
use of PMRT and comorbidity or frailty, for each risk group. In women with an 
intermediate risk, unadjusted rates of PMRT varied substantially between 
geographical regions (range 40.3-77.3%), but varied less for the high-risk 
(range 77.1-91.6%) and low-risk groups (range 4.1-32.9%). Adjusting for patient 
case-mix reduced the variation in regional and organisational PMRT rates to a 
small degree.
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of PMRT are consistently high across England and Wales among 
women with high-risk EIBC, but variation exists across regions and organisations 
for women with intermediate-risk EIBC. Effort is required to reduce unwarranted 
variation in practice for intermediate-risk EIBC.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clon.2023.05.016

metastasis, the use of the hepatic artery infusion pump was expanded to deliver 
chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting after hepatic resection about 1 decade 
later. Though the initial randomized clinical trial comparing the hepatic artery 
infusion pump to resection alone failed to show an improvement in overall 
survival, 2 large randomized clinical trials, namely the Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (1999) and European Cooperative Group (2002) trials, did 
report improved hepatic disease-free survival with the use of a hepatic artery 
infusion pump. There remained limited evidence of a replicable improvement in 
overall survival, and the expansion of hepatic artery infusion pump into the 
adjuvant space was cautioned by a Cochrane review in 2006, highlighting the need 
for further studies to establish a consistent benefit. Those data were 
forthcoming over the 2000s and 2010s in large-scale retrospective analyses for 
the most part, but the recommendations from international guidelines remain 
equivocal to this day. With widespread retrospective data and high-quality 
randomized clinical trial evidence that a hepatic artery infusion pump in the 
setting of resected hepatic metastasis from colorectal liver metastasis 
decreases hepatic recurrence and indications that it may improve overall 
survival, it is clear that there is a subset of patients that greatly benefit 
from this treatment modality. New randomized clinical trials, specifically in 
the adjuvant setting, are currently enrolling and should continue to elucidate 
the benefit that hepatic artery infusion pumps may confer. That being said, it 
remains a challenge to reliably identify these patients, and the procedure is 
limited by complexity and resources to high-volume academic centers, leaving 
accessibility as a further potential barrier for patients. It remains to be seen 
what volume of literature may shift the hepatic artery infusion pump into the 
standard of care, but adjuvant hepatic artery infusion pump in the setting of 
colorectal liver metastasis should certainly be explored further as a validated

""integrated diagnosis"" of CNS tumors. We aimed to determine whether radiomics 
could distinguish molecular types of pontine pediatric high-grade gliomas that 
have similar/overlapping phenotypes on conventional anatomic MR images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline MR images from children with pontine pediatric 
high-grade gliomas were analyzed. Retrospective imaging studies included 
standard precontrast and postcontrast sequences and DTI. Imaging analyses 
included median, mean, mode, skewness, and kurtosis of the ADC histogram of the 
tumor volume based on T2 FLAIR and enhancement at baseline. Histone H3 mutations 
were identified through immunohistochemistry and/or Sanger or next-generation 
DNA sequencing. The log-rank test identified imaging factors prognostic of 
survival from the time of diagnosis. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher exact tests 
compared imaging predictors among groups.
RESULTS: Eighty-three patients had pretreatment MR imaging and evaluable tissue 
sampling. The median age was 6 years (range, 0.7-17 years); 50 tumors had a K27M 
mutation in H3-3A, and 11, in H3C2/3. Seven tumors had histone H3 K27 
alteration, but the specific gene was unknown. Fifteen were H3 wild-type. 
Overall survival was significantly higher in H3C2/3- compared with H3-3A-mutant 
tumors (P = .003) and in wild-type tumors compared with any histone mutation (P 
= .001). Lower overall survival was observed in patients with enhancing tumors 
(P = .02) compared with those without enhancement. H3C2/3-mutant tumors showed 
higher mean, median, and mode ADC_total values (P < .001) and ADC_enhancement 
(P < .004), with lower ADC_total skewness and kurtosis (P < .003) relative to 
H3-3A-mutant tumors.

tumor in childhood. Intra-arterial chemotherapy is becoming the standard of care 
for both first-line and rescue therapy, thus improving survival rates and 
decreasing the adverse effects of retinoblastoma treatment. Cardiorespiratory 
adverse events during general anesthesia for intra-arterial chemotherapy, 
including decreased lung compliance and bradycardia, have been described, but 
data regarding associated factors are still lacking. We aimed to assess the 
characteristics of patients and procedures associated with cardiorespiratory 
events during intra-arterial chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective monocenter observational study 
in children diagnosed with retinoblastoma undergoing intra-arterial chemotherapy 
under general anesthesia. The occurrence of cardiorespiratory events was 
registered. We also assessed clinical and procedural characteristics potentially 
associated with these events.
RESULTS: A cardiorespiratory event was observed in 22 (12.5%) procedures, 
predominantly a decrease in tidal volume observed in 16 (9%) procedures. The 
median age was lower in the procedures with a cardiorespiratory event (20.43 
[SD, 11.76] months versus 30.11 [SD, 24.17] months) (P < .05). Other variables 
such as bilateral disease or a previous intra-arterial chemotherapy treatment 
were not associated with the occurrence of a cardiorespiratory event.
CONCLUSIONS: In children undergoing intra-arterial chemotherapy for

brands below the minimum legal price (MLP), and smugglers selling illicit brands 
at or above the MLP.
METHODS: For the first time in Brazil, self-reported information on cigarette 
brand name and price paid per pack in smokers' last purchase from a nationally 
representative survey conducted in 2019 was used to distinguish the illicit and 
the legal markets. We estimated the proportion of illicit cigarette consumption, 
using the combination of brand and price.
RESULTS: The proportion of smuggled illicit cigarette consumption based on 
brands not approved on the Brazilian market was estimated at 38.6% (95% CI: 
35.8% to 41.5%). When we added legal brands not paying taxes, it increased to 
47.1% (95% CI: 44.2% to 49.9%). Around 25% of illicit brand cigarettes were sold 
at or above MLP.
CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, since 2017 there is a lack of adjustment in tobacco 
taxes and the MLP for inflation and income growth. The increase in cigarette 
affordability and the presence on the market of a segment of 'higher-priced' 
illicit brands suggest patterns of illicit brand loyalty and/or perceived 'brand 
quality' among smokers of illicit cigarettes. The evidence also shows that a 
sizeable proportion of legal brand cigarettes were sold below the MLP. This 
study offers insight into what happened in circumstances in which a government 
failed to keep current with tax policies and the monitoring of domestic 
manufacturing. Brazil has been a world leader in the monitoring of the tobacco 
epidemic, and this study also offers an innovative use of data that an 
increasing number of countries are collecting.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

distal upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Nonetheless, SU has been 
performed infrequently in the real world, and there is no consensus on the 
preferred surgical technique in laparoscopic surgery. We describe our first 
experience of laparoscopic segmental ureterectomy (LSU) with psoas hitch 
ureteral reimplantation.
MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: LSU starts using a fan-shaped, five-port, 
transperitoneal approach. First, the cancerous ureter segment is clipped to 
avoid tumor seeding, and then the diseased segment is dissected. Second, the 
psoas hitch is performed by fixing the external part of the ipsilateral dome of 
the bladder to the psoas muscle and its tendon. Third, at the top of the 
bladder, an incision is made in the muscle layer and mucosa. The ureter is then 
spatulated. A guide wire is used to place a retrograde ureteral double J stent. 
Finally, the anastomosis of the bladder and ureter mucosa is performed by 
interrupted suturing of both ends, followed by continuous suturing, and the 
muscular layer of the bladder is closed in a double layer. We performed LSU for 
distal UTUC in 10 patients. There was no decrease in renal function before or 
after surgery. During follow-up, three patients experienced a recurrence of 
urothelial carcinoma in the bladder and one patient had a local recurrence.
DISCUSSION: LSU is a safe and feasible procedure in our experience, and it can 
be recommended for selected cases of distal UTUC with optimal perioperative, 
renal functional, and oncologic outcomes.","© 2023 Asia Endosurgery Task Force and Japan Society of Endoscopic Surgery and

cancer (CRC) risk in the general population, whereas its role in Lynch syndrome 
(LS), the most common type of hereditary CRC, is still conflicting. We aimed to 
assess the ability of PRS to refine CRC risk prediction in European-descendant 
individuals with LS.
METHODS: 1465 individuals with LS (557 MLH1, 517 MSH2/EPCAM, 299 MSH6 and 92 
PMS2) and 5656 CRC-free population-based controls from two independent cohorts 
were included. A 91-SNP PRS was applied. A Cox proportional hazard regression 
model with 'family' as a random effect and a logistic regression analysis, 
followed by a meta-analysis combining both cohorts were conducted.
RESULTS: Overall, we did not observe a statistically significant association 
between PRS and CRC risk in the entire cohort. Nevertheless, PRS was 
significantly associated with a slightly increased risk of CRC or advanced 
adenoma (AA), in those with CRC diagnosed <50 years and in individuals with 
multiple CRCs or AAs diagnosed <60 years.
CONCLUSION: The PRS may slightly influence CRC risk in individuals with LS in 
particular in more extreme phenotypes such as early-onset disease. However, the 
study design and recruitment strategy strongly influence the results of PRS 
studies. A separate analysis by genes and its combination with other genetic and 
non-genetic risk factors will help refine its role as a risk modifier in LS.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use. See rights and

(CVD) is increasing, reflecting ageing global populations, rising burden of 
shared cardiometabolic risk factors, and improved cancer survival. Many cancer 
treatments carry a risk of cardiotoxicity. Baseline cardiovascular risk 
assessment is recommended in all patients with cancer and requires consideration 
of individual patient risk and the cardiotoxicity profile of proposed anticancer 
therapies. Patients with pre-existing CVD are potentially at high or very high 
risk of cancer-therapy related cardiovascular toxicity. The detection of 
pre-existing CVD should prompt cardiac optimisation and planning of surveillance 
during cancer treatment. In patients with severe CVD, the risk of certain cancer 
therapies may be prohibitively high. Such decisions require multidisciplinary 
discussion with consideration of alternative anti-cancer therapies, risk-benefit 
assessment, and patient preference. Current practice is primarily guided by 
expert opinion and data from select clinical cohorts. There is need for 
development of a stronger evidence base to guide clinical practice in 
cardio-oncology. The establishment of multicentre international registries and 
national-level healthcare data linkage projects are important steps towards 
facilitating enrichment of cardio-oncology research programmes. In this 
narrative review, we consider epidemiological trends of cancer and CVD 
comorbidities and the impact of their co-occurrence on clinical outcomes, 
current approach to supporting cancer patients with pre-existing CVD and gaps in 
existing knowledge.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use. See rights and

promise as cancer diagnostic agents; however, the relatively short tumor 
retention of FAPIs may limit their application in radioligand therapy. In this 
paper, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a FAPI tetramer. The 
aim of the study was to evaluate the tumor-targeting characteristics of 
radiolabeled FAPI multimers in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing information 
for the design of FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals based on the polyvalency 
principle. Methods: FAPI tetramers were synthesized on the basis of FAPI-46 and 
radiolabeled with 68Ga, 64Cu, and 177Lu. In vitro FAP-binding characteristics 
were identified using a competitive cell-binding experiment. To evaluate their 
pharmacokinetics, small-animal PET, SPECT, and ex vivo biodistribution analyses 
were performed on HT-1080-FAP and U87MG tumor-bearing mice. In addition, the 2 
tumor xenografts received radioligand therapy with 177Lu-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4, and the 
antitumor efficacy of the 177Lu-FAPI tetramer was evaluated and compared with 
that of the 177Lu-FAPI dimer and monomer. Results: 68Ga-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4 and 
177Lu-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4 were highly stable in phosphate-buffered saline and fetal 
bovine serum. The FAPI tetramer exhibited high FAP-binding affinity and 
specificity both in vitro and in vivo. 68Ga-, 64Cu-, and 177Lu-labeled FAPI 
tetramers exhibited higher tumor uptake, longer tumor retention, and slower 
clearance than FAPI dimers and FAPI-46 in HT-1080-FAP tumors. The uptake 
(percentage injected dose per gram) of 177Lu-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4, 
177Lu-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2, and 177Lu-FAPI-46 in HT-1080-FAP tumors at 24 h was 
21.4 ± 1.7, 17.1 ± 3.9, and 3.4 ± 0.7, respectively. Moreover, 
68Ga-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4 uptake in U87MG tumors was approximately 2-fold the uptake 
of 68Ga-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2 (SUVmean, 0.72 ± 0.02 vs. 0.42 ± 0.03, P < 0.001) and 
more than 4-fold the uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-46 (0.16 ± 0.01, P < 0.001). In the 
radioligand therapy study, remarkable tumor suppression was observed with the 
177Lu-FAPI tetramer in both HT-1080-FAP and U87MG tumor-bearing mice. 
Conclusion: The satisfactory FAP-binding affinity and specificity, as well as 
the favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics of the FAPI tetramer, make it a promising 
radiopharmaceutical for theranostic applications. Improved tumor uptake and 
prolonged retention of the 177Lu-FAPI tetramer resulted in excellent 
characteristics for FAPI imaging and radioligand therapy.",© 2023 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.,"DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.123.265599

(RLT) is a new treatment option for metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC). Its low toxicity profile favors use in elderly patients or in 
patients with critical comorbidities. The purpose of this analysis was to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of [177Lu]-PSMA RLT in mCRPC patients at least 
80 y old. Methods: Eighty mCRPC patients at least 80 y old underwent 
[177Lu]-PSMA-I&T RLT and were retrospectively selected. The patients were 
previously treated by androgen receptor-directed therapy, received taxane-based 
chemotherapy, or were chemotherapy-ineligible. The best prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) response was calculated, as well as clinical progression-free 
survival (cPFS) and overall survival (OS). Toxicity data were acquired until 
6 mo after the last treatment cycle. Results: Of 80 patients, 49 (61.3%) were 
chemotherapy-naïve and 16 (20%) had visceral metastases. The median number of 
previous mCRPC treatment regimens was 2. In total, 324 cycles (median, 4 cycles; 
range, 1-12) with a median cumulative activity of 23.8 GBq (interquartile range, 
14.8-42.2) were applied. A PSA decline of 50% was achieved in 37 (46.3%) 
patients. Chemotherapy-naïve patients showed higher 50% PSA response rates than 
chemotherapy-pretreated patients (51.0% vs. 38.7%, respectively). Overall, 
median cPFS and OS were 8.7 and 16.1 mo, respectively. The median cPFS and OS of 
chemotherapy-naïve patients were significantly longer than those of 
chemotherapy-pretreated patients (10.5 vs. 6.5 mo and 20.7 vs. 11.8 mo, 
respectively, P < 0.05). A lower hemoglobin level and higher lactate 
dehydrogenase level at baseline were independent predictors of shorter cPFS and 
OS. Treatment-emergent grade 3 toxicities were anemia in 4 patients (5%), 
thrombocytopenia in 3 patients (3.8%), and renal impairment in 4 patients (5%). 
No nonhematologic grade 3 and no grade 4 toxicities were observed. The most 
frequent clinical side effects were grade 1-2 xerostomia, fatigue, and 
inappetence. Conclusion: [177Lu]-PSMA-I&T RLT in mCRPC patients at least 80 y 
old is safe and effective, comparable to previously published data on 
non-age-selected cohorts with a low rate of high-grade toxicities. 
Chemotherapy-naïve patients showed a better and longer response to therapy than 
taxane-pretreated patients. [177Lu]-PSMA RLT seems to be a meaningful treatment 
option for older patients.",© 2023 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.,"DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.122.265259

progression of age-related tau pathology in the medial temporal cortex. The tau 
PET tracer N-(4-[18F]fluoro-5-methylpyridin-2-yl)-7-aminoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 
([18F]SNFT-1) has been successfully developed by optimizing 
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives. We characterized the binding properties of 
[18F]SNFT-1 using a head-to-head comparison with other reported 18F-labeled tau 
tracers. Methods: The binding affinity of SNFT-1 to tau, amyloid, and monoamine 
oxidase A and B was compared with that of the second-generation tau tracers 
MK-6240, PM-PBB3, PI-2620, RO6958948, JNJ-64326067, and flortaucipir. In vitro 
binding properties of 18F-labeled tau tracers were evaluated through the 
autoradiography of frozen human brain tissues from patients with diverse 
neurodegenerative disease spectra. Pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and radiation 
dosimetry were assessed in normal mice after intravenous administration of 
[18F]SNFT-1. Results: In vitro binding assays demonstrated that [18F]SNFT-1 
possesses high selectivity and high affinity for tau aggregates in Alzheimer 
disease (AD) brains. Autoradiographic analysis of tau deposits in medial 
temporal brain sections from patients with AD showed a higher 
signal-to-background ratio for [18F]SNFT-1 than for the other tau PET tracers 
and no significant binding with non-AD tau, α-synuclein, transactiviation 
response DNA-binding protein-43, and transmembrane protein 106B aggregates in 
human brain sections. Furthermore, [18F]SNFT-1 did not bind significantly to 
various receptors, ion channels, or transporters. [18F]SNFT-1 showed a high 
initial brain uptake and rapid washout from the brains of normal mice without 
radiolabeled metabolites. Conclusion: These preclinical data suggest that 
[18F]SNFT-1 is a promising and selective tau radiotracer candidate that allows 
the quantitative monitoring of age-related accumulation of tau aggregates in the

and quality of life (QoL) compared with total mesorectal excision (TME) for 
rectal cancer. Only 10% of patients are eligible for organ preservation 
following short-course radiotherapy (SCRT, 25 Gy in five fractions) and a 
prolonged interval (4-8 weeks) to response evaluation. The organ preservation 
rate could potentially be increased by dose-escalated radiotherapy. Online 
adaptive magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) is anticipated to reduce 
radiation-induced toxicity and enable radiotherapy dose escalation. This trial 
aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dose-escalated SCRT using 
online adaptive MRgRT.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The preRADAR is a multicentre phase I trial with a 6+3 
dose-escalation design. Patients with intermediate-risk rectal cancer 
(cT3c-d(MRF-)N1M0 or cT1-3(MRF-)N1M0) interested in organ preservation are 
eligible. Patients are treated with a radiotherapy boost of 2×5 Gy (level 0), 
3×5 Gy (level 1), 4×5 Gy (level 2) or 5×5 Gy (level 3) on the gross tumour 
volume in the week following standard SCRT using online adaptive MRgRT. The 
trial starts on dose level 1. The primary endpoint is the MTD based on the 
incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) per dose level. DLT is a composite of 
maximum one in nine severe radiation-induced toxicities and maximum one in three 
severe postoperative complications, in patients treated with TME or local 
excision within 26 weeks following start of treatment. Secondary endpoints 
include the organ preservation rate, non-DLT, oncological outcomes, 
patient-reported QoL and functional outcomes up to 2 years following start of 
treatment. Imaging and laboratory biomarkers are explored for early response 
prediction.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial protocol has been approved by the Medical 
Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht. The primary and 
secondary trial results will be published in international peer-reviewed 
journals.

malignancy with a poor response to chemotherapy and an extremely poor prognosis. 
Recent studies have revealed that phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic 
pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP) can inhibit the growth of various cancers. 
Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the antitumor effects 
of LHPP in PDAC and to explore its mechanism using proteomics analysis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples 
demonstrated that LHPP expression levels were lower in tumor tissues compared to 
adjacent nontumor tissues. Moreover, multivariate COX regression analysis showed 
that LHPP expression level was an independent prognostic factor for the patients 
with PDAC. Patients with high LHPP expression had a better prognosis. The 
lentiviral vectors for normal control (NC), LHPP knockdown (KD), and LHPP 
overexpression (OE) were infected with BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cell lines. Cell 
counting kit-8 assay, Transwell assay, and flow cytometry analyses showed that 
LHPP overexpression significantly inhibited the cell viability, migration, and 
proliferation of BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells. Moreover, xenograft tumor model 
demonstrated that LHPP overexpression inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo. 
Subsequently, proteins with significantly altered expression in BxPC-3 cells 
after lentivirus infection were detected using proteomics analyses. 
Interestingly, compared to the NC group, the expression of Syndecan 1 (SDC1) was 
significantly upregulated in the KD group, while that of S100P was significantly 
downregulated in the OE group.
CONCLUSION: LHPP might emerge as an important target for delaying the 
advancement of PDAC, thereby providing a novel therapeutic approach for the 
treatment of PDAC.","DOI: 10.1177/15330338231177807

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinicopathological features and outcomes in patients 
with endometrial cancer with isolated lymphatic recurrence after 
lymphadenectomy, stratified by different isolated lymphatic recurrence sites and 
treatment approaches.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all surgically treated patients with 
endometrial cancer, identifying those with recurrence. We defined primary 
isolated lymphatic recurrence as the first and unique evidence of recurrence in 
lymph node-bearing areas, without concomitant vaginal, hematogenous, or 
peritoneal recurrence. Isolated lymphatic recurrences were classified as pelvic, 
para-aortic, distant, or multiple sites. Our primary outcome was cause-specific 
survival after diagnosis of the recurrence.
RESULTS: Among 4216 patients with surgically staged endometrial cancer, we 
identified 66 (1.6%) women with isolated lymphatic recurrence. The overall 
median cause-specific survival for patients with isolated lymphatic recurrence 
was 24 months. Although cause-specific survival was not significantly different 
between the four isolated lymphatic recurrence groups (p=0.21), 7 of 15 (47%) 
patients with isolated lymphatic recurrence in the para-aortic area were 
long-term survivors. At multivariate Cox regression, the absence of 
lymphovascular space invasion and grade 1 histology in the primary tumor were 
significantly associated with improved cause-specific survival. In addition, 
patients with isolated lymphatic recurrence who underwent surgery for recurrence 
(with/without other associated therapies) had improved cause-specific survival 
compared with patients who did not undergo surgery, also after adjusting for 
age.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade histology and absence of lymphovascular space invasion in 
the primary tumor were predictors of improved prognosis in patients with 
endometrial cancer with isolated lymphatic recurrence. In addition, in this 
retrospective cohort, patients with isolated lymphatic recurrence who were 
selected for eradicative surgical treatment had improved cause-specific 
survival.","© IGCS and ESGO 2023. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

feasibility and preliminary efficacy of Mika, an app-based digital therapeutic 
intervention hypothesized to improve management and the support of cancer 
patients.
METHODS: Patients with gynecological malignancies undergoing post-operative or 
routine outpatient chemotherapy were randomized (5:2) into intervention (Mika 
plus treatment-as-usual) and control (treatment-as-usual alone). Feasibility 
outcomes including dropout rate, reasons for dropout, and intervention 
adherence, as well as efficacy outcomes including depression, fatigue, and 
health literacy were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Changes in 
efficacy outcomes from baseline to week 12 were evaluated in the intervention 
group only by means of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
RESULTS: Seventy participants (intervention group, n=50; control group, n=20) 
with gynecological cancer (ovarian, cervical, and endometrial) were randomized. 
The dropout rate increased from 15.7% (11/70) between baseline and week 4 to 
37.1% (26/70) between weeks 8 and 12. Primary reasons for dropout were death 
(n=10) and health status deterioration (n=11). The initial high intervention 
adherence observed between baseline and week 4 (86% usage rate, average usage 
time: 120 min, average number of logins: 16.7) declined in weeks 8 to 12 (46% 
usage rate, average usage time: 41 min, average number of logins: 9). 
Participants in the intervention group showed significant intra-individual 
reductions in depressive symptoms by 42% (d=0.85) and fatigue symptoms by 23.1% 
(d=0.5) from baseline to 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides initial evidence of the feasibility and 
efficacy of Mika in improving the well-being of cancer patients. The high 
initial intervention adherence and significant reductions in depressive and 
fatigue symptoms suggest that Mika has the potential to improve the management 
and support of cancer patients.

identified on CT scans performed for lung cancer screening. Uncertainty 
regarding their clinical significance and how and when such findings should be 
reported back to clinicians and participants persists. We examined the 
prevalence of non-malignant incidental findings within a lung cancer screening 
cohort and investigated the morbidity and relevant risk factors associated with 
incidental findings. We quantified the primary and secondary care referrals 
generated by our protocol.
METHODS: The SUMMIT study (NCT03934866) is a prospective observational cohort 
study to examine the performance of delivering a low-dose CT (LDCT) screening 
service to a high-risk population. Spirometry, blood pressure, height/weight and 
respiratory history were assessed as part of a Lung Health Check. Individuals at 
high risk of lung cancer were offered an LDCT and returned for two further 
annual visits. This analysis is a prospective evaluation of the standardised 
reporting and management protocol for incidental findings developed for the 
study on the baseline LDCT.
RESULTS: In 11 115 participants included in this analysis, the most common 
incidental findings were coronary artery calcification (64.2%) and emphysema 
(33.4%). From our protocolised management approach, the number of participants 
requiring review for clinically relevant findings in primary care was 1 in 20, 
and the number potentially requiring review in secondary care was 1 in 25.
CONCLUSIONS: Incidental findings are common in lung cancer screening and can be 
associated with reported symptoms and comorbidities. A standardised reporting 
protocol allows systematic assessment and standardises onward management.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations that occur more 
frequently among Asians (30%-50%) as opposed to Caucasians (10%-15%). Lung 
cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in India, with a reported 
adenocarcinoma positivity ranging between 26.1% and 86.9% in NSCLC patients. The 
prevalence of EGFR mutations in adenocarcinoma patients (36.9%) in India is 
higher than that of Caucasian patients and lower than that of East Asian 
patients. The exon 19 deletion (Ex19del) is more common than exon 21 L858R 
mutations in Indian patients with NSCLC. Studies have shown that the clinical 
behaviour of patients with advanced NSCLC differs between EGFR Ex19del and exon

clinicopathological features and survival outcomes after first line and 
second-line treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) in NSCLC 
patients with Ex19del and exon 21 L858R EGFR mutation status. This study also

(HNSCC) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To target 
upregulated ErbB dimer expression in this cancer, we developed an autologous 
CD28-based chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) approach named T4 
immunotherapy. Patient-derived T-cells are engineered by retroviral transduction 
to coexpress a panErbB-specific CAR called T1E28ζ and an IL-4-responsive 
chimeric cytokine receptor, 4αβ, which allows IL-4-mediated enrichment of 
transduced cells during manufacture. These cells elicit preclinical antitumor 
activity against HNSCC and other carcinomas. In this trial, we used intratumoral 
delivery to mitigate significant clinical risk of on-target off-tumor toxicity 
owing to low-level ErbB expression in healthy tissues.
METHODS: We undertook a phase 1 dose-escalation 3+3 trial of intratumoral T4 
immunotherapy in HNSCC (NCT01818323). CAR T-cell batches were manufactured from 
40 to 130 mL of whole blood using a 2-week semiclosed process. A single CAR 
T-cell treatment, formulated as a fresh product in 1-4 mL of medium, was 
injected into one or more target lesions. Dose of CAR T-cells was escalated in 5 
cohorts from 1×107-1×109 T4+ T-cells, administered without prior 
lymphodepletion.
RESULTS: Despite baseline lymphopenia in most enrolled subjects, the target cell 
dose was successfully manufactured in all cases, yielding up to 7.5 billion 
T-cells (67.5±11.8% transduced), without any batch failures. Treatment-related 
adverse events were all grade 2 or less, with no dose-limiting toxicities 
(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.4.0). Frequent 
treatment-related adverse events were tumor swelling, pain, pyrexias, chills, 
and fatigue. There was no evidence of leakage of T4+ T-cells into the 
circulation following intratumoral delivery, and injection of radiolabeled cells 
demonstrated intratumoral persistence. Despite rapid progression at trial entry, 
stabilization of disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1) 
was observed in 9 of 15 subjects (60%) at 6 weeks post-CAR T-cell 
administration. Subsequent treatment with pembrolizumab and T-VEC oncolytic 
virus achieved a rapid complete clinical response in one subject, which was 
durable for over 3 years. Median overall survival was greater than for 
historical controls. Disease stabilization was associated with the 
administration of an immunophenotypically fitter, less exhausted, T4 CAR T-cell 
product.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the safe intratumoral administration of T4 
immunotherapy in advanced HNSCC.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published

interest and to quantify the effect of the expanded 2021 lung cancer screening 
eligibility criteria among women presenting for screening mammography, a group 
with demonstrable interest in cancer screening.
METHODS: A single-page survey was distributed to patients presenting for 
screening mammography, from January-March 2020 and June 2020-January 2021, at 2 
academic medical centers on the East and West Coasts. The population served by 
the East Coast institution has greater poverty, greater ethnic/racial diversity, 
and lower education levels. Survey questions included age, smoking history, lung 
cancer screening knowledge, participation, and interest. Lung cancer screening 
eligibility was determined for both 2013 and 2021 USPSTF guidelines. Descriptive 
statistics were calculated, and data were compared between groups using the 
Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney nonparametric test, and the 2-sample t test.
RESULTS: 5512 surveys were completed; 33% (1824) of women reported a history of 
smoking-30% (1656) former smokers and 3% (156) current smokers. Among women with 
a smoking history, 7% (127/1824) were eligible for lung cancer screening using 
2013% and 11% (207/1824) using the 2021 USPSTF criteria. Interest in lung cancer 
screening was high (73%; 151/207) among eligible women using 2021 USPSTF 
criteria, but only 42% (87/207) had heard of lung cancer screening and only 28% 
(57/207) had received prior LDCT screening.
CONCLUSION: Eligible screening mammography patients reported high levels of 
interest in lung cancer screening but low levels of knowledge and participation.

recently developed procedure that has the potential to prevent post-ESD 
coagulation syndrome (PECS) owing to its heat-sink effect. We aimed to clarify 
whether U-ESD decreases the incidence of PECS compared with conventional ESD 
(C-ESD).
METHODS: A total of 205 patients who underwent colorectal ESD (C-ESD: 125; 
U-ESD: 80) were analyzed. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to 
adjust for patient backgrounds. Ten C-ESD and two U-ESD patients with muscle 
damage or perforation during ESD were excluded when comparing PECS. The primary 
outcome was to compare the incidence of PECS between the U-ESD and C-ESD groups 
(54 matched pairs). Secondary outcomes were to compare procedural outcomes 
between the C-ESD and U-ESD groups (62 matched pairs).
RESULTS: Among the 78 patients who underwent U-ESD, PECS occurred in only one 
patient (1.3%). Adjusted comparisons between the U-ESD and C-ESD groups 
demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of PECS in the U-ESD group (0% vs 
11.1%; P = 0.027). Median dissection speed was significantly faster in the U-ESD 
than in the C-ESD group (10.9 mm2 /min vs 6.9 mm2 /min; P < 0.001). En bloc and 
complete resection rates were 100% in the U-ESD group. Although perforation and 
delayed bleeding occurred in one patient each (1.6%) as adverse events in the 
U-ESD group, there were no differences compared with the C-ESD group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that U-ESD effectively decreases the 
incidence of PECS and is a faster and safer method for colorectal ESD.","© 2023 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley &

of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron 
emission tomography (PET)-CT in para-aortic lymph node metastasis of cervical 
cancer.
PURPOSE: To compare and analyze the para-aortic lymph node presentations found 
in cervical cancer on different images in order to determine the best precise 
imaging method for identifying metastatic lymph nodes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and other databases were 
searched for the non-invasive detection of metastatic lymph nodes for a 
comprehensive comparison.
RESULTS: Positive lymph nodes on CT are significantly related to the following 
factors: short axis ≥10 mm; and round or central necrosis. Positive lymph nodes 
on MRI are significantly related to the following factors: short axis ≥8 mm; 
inhomogeneous signal intensity; morphology: round, irregular edge, extracapsular 
invasion, central necrosis, loss of lymph node structure, burrs, or lobes; and 
ADC value decreases, combined with local actuality. On PET-CT examination, when 
the short axis of the lymph node is >5 mm, the SUV is >2.5, or the FDG uptake is 
greater than that of the surrounding tissue, it is a metastatic lymph node.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, different imaging techniques show metastatic lymph 
nodes in different ways. Combining the patient's medical history with the 
symptoms of the aforementioned lymph nodes, together with one or more imaging 
techniques, is important to diagnose para-aortic lymph nodes in cervical cancer.","DOI: 10.1177/02841851231179178

(OLE) period of the Phase I/II COMPOSER trial (NCT03157635) that evaluated 
crovalimab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, who were 
treatment-naive or switched from eculizumab at enrolment.
METHODS: COMPOSER consists of four sequential parts followed by the OLE. The 
primary OLE objective was to assess long-term crovalimab safety, with a 
secondary objective to assess crovalimab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints included change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
transfusion avoidance, haemoglobin stabilisation and breakthrough haemolysis 
(BTH).
RESULTS: A total 43 of 44 patients entered the OLE after completing the primary 
treatment period. Overall, 14 of 44 (32%) experienced treatment-related adverse 
events. Steady state exposure levels of crovalimab and terminal complement 
inhibition were maintained over the OLE. During the OLE, mean normalised LDH was 
generally maintained at ≤1.5× upper limit of normal, transfusion avoidance was 
achieved in 83%-92% of patients and haemoglobin stabilisation was reached in 
79%-88% of patients across each 24-week interval. Five BTH events occurred with 
none leading to withdrawal.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a 3-year median treatment duration, crovalimab was well 
tolerated and sustained C5 inhibition was achieved. Intravascular haemolysis 
control, haemoglobin stabilisation and transfusion avoidance were maintained, 
signifying long-term crovalimab efficacy.","© 2023 The Authors. European Journal of Haematology published by John Wiley &

This study investigated the mechanisms of brazilin-induced cell death in the T24 
human bladder cancer cell line. Low serum cell culture and the lactate 
dehydrogenase assay were used to confirm the antitumor effect of brazilin. 
Annexin V and propidium iodide double staining, transmission electron 
microscopy, fluo-3-AM assay for Ca2+ mobilization and caspase activity assay 
were performed to identify the type of cell death after brazilin treatment. 
Mitochondria membrane potentials were measured using JC-1. Quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses were performed to 
verify the expression of the necroptosis-related genes and proteins receptor 
interacting protein 1 (RIP1), RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). 
The results showed that brazilin induced necrosis in T24 cells and upregulated 
the mRNA and protein levels of RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL and Ca2+ influx. The 
necroptosis-mediated cell death was rescued by the necroptosis inhibitor 
necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), but not by the apoptosis inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Brazilin 
repressed caspase 8 expression and decreased the mitochondrial membrane 
potentials; both effects were partially reversed by Nec-1. Brazilin induced 
physiological and morphological changes in T24 cells and RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated 
necroptosis might be involved. In conclusion, the results confirm the 
involvement of necroptosis in brazilin-induced cell death and suggest that 
brazilin could be explored as an anticancer agent against bladder cancer.","© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","DOI: 10.1111/1440-1681.13800

Heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) is an attractive photothermal reagent because of its 
large molar absorption coefficient, good biocompatibility, and absorption of 
near-infrared irradiation. However, the photothermal conversion efficiency of 
Cy7 is limited without ingenious excitation-state regulation. In this study, the 
photothermal conversion ability of Cy7 is efficiently enhanced based on 
photo-induced electron transfer (PET)-triggered structural deformation. Three 
Cy7 derivatives, whose Cl is replaced by carbazole, phenoxazine, and 
phenothiazine at the meso-position (CZ-Cy7, PXZ-Cy7, and PTZ-Cy7), are presented 
as examples to demonstrate the regulation of the energy release of the excited 
states. Because the phenothiazine moiety exhibits an obvious PET-induced 
structural deformation in the excited state, which quenches the fluorescence and 
inhibits intersystem crossing of S1 →T1 , PTZ-Cy7 exhibits a photothermal 
conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 77.5%. As a control, only PET occurs in 
PXZ-Cy7, with a PCE of 43.5%. Furthermore, the PCE of CZ-Cy7 is only 13.0% 
because there is no PET process. Interestingly, PTZ-Cy7 self-assembles into

targeted therapeutics. Gemcitabine is approved for several human cancers and the 
first line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, gemcitabine resistance frequently occurs and is 
a major problem in successful treatments of these cancers and the mechanism of 
gemcitabine resistance remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified 65 
genes that had reversible methylation changes in their promoters in gemcitabine 
resistant PDAC cells using whole genome Reduced Representation Bisulfite 
Sequencing analyses. One of these genes, PDGFD, was further studied in detail 
for its reversible epigenetic regulation in expression and shown to contribute 
to gemcitabine resistance in vitro and in vivo via stimulating STAT3 signaling 
in both autocrine and paracrine manners to upregulate RRM1 expression. Analyses 
of TCGA datasets showed that PDGFD positively associates with poor outcome of 
PDAC patients. Together, we conclude that the reversible epigenetic upregulation 
plays an important role in gemcitabine resistance development and targeting 
PDGFD signaling alleviates gemcitabine resistance for PDAC treatment.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.canlet.2023.216266

standard of care for some tumor types. However, the majority of patients do not 
benefit from current immunotherapeutics and many develop severe toxicities. 
Therefore, the identification of biomarkers to classify patients as likely 
responders or non-responders to immunotherapy is a timely task. Here, we test 
ultrasound imaging markers of tumor stiffness and perfusion. Ultrasound imaging 
is non-invasive and clinically available and can be used both for stiffness and 
perfusion evaluation. In this study, we employed syngeneic orthotopic models of 
two breast cancers, a fibrosarcoma and melanoma, to demonstrate that 
ultrasound-derived measures of tumor stiffness and perfusion (i.e., blood 
volume) correlate with the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in 
terms of changes in primary tumor volume. To modulate tumor stiffness and 
perfusion and thus, get a range of therapeutic outcomes, we employed the 
mechanotherapeutic tranilast. Mechanotherapeutics combined with ICI are 
advancing through clinical trials, but biomarkers of response have not been 
tested until now. We found the existence of linear correlations between tumor 
stiffness and perfusion imaging biomarkers as well as strong linear correlations 
between the stiffness and perfusion markers with ICI efficacy on primary tumor 
growth rates. Our findings set the basis for ultrasound imaging biomarkers 
predictive of ICI therapy in combination with mechanotherapeutics. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE: Hypothesis: Monitoring Tumor Microenvironment (TME) mechanical 
abnormalities can predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and 
provide biomarkers predictive of response. Tumor stiffening and solid stress 
elevation are hallmarks of tumor patho-physiology in desmoplastic tumors. They 
induce hypo-perfusion and hypoxia by compressing tumor vessels, posing major 
barriers to immunotherapy. Mechanotherapeutics is a new class of drugs that 
target the TME to reduce stiffness and improve perfusion and oxygenation. In 
this study, we show that measures of stiffness and perfusion derived from 
ultrasound shear wave elastography and contrast enhanced ultrasound can provide 
biomarkers of tumor response.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.actbio.2023.06.007

CircHULC in malignancies has yet to be elucidated.
METHODS: Gene infection, tumorigenesis test in vitro and in vivo and the 
signaling pathway analysis were performed.
RESULTS: our results indicate that CircHULC promotes growth of human liver 
cancer stem cells and the malignant differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells. 
Mechanistically, CircHULC enhances the methylation modification of PKM2 via 
CARM1 and the deacetylase Sirt1. Moreover, CircHULC enhances the binding ability 
of TP53INP2/DOR with LC3 and LC3 with ATG4, ATG3, ATG5, ATG12. Therefore, 
CircHULC promotes the formation of autophagosomes. In particular, the binding 
ability of phosphorylated Beclin1 (Ser14) to Vps15, Vps34, ATG14L were 
significantly increased after CircHULC was overexpressed. Strikingly, CircHULC 
affects the expression of chromatin reprogramming factors and oncogenes through 
autophagy. Thereafter, Oct4, Sox2, KLF4, Nanog, and GADD45 were significantly 
decreased and C-myc was increased after CircHULC was overexpressed. Thus, 
CircHULC promotes the expression of H-Ras, SGK, P70S6K, 4E-BP1, Jun, and AKT. 
Interestingly, both CARM1 and Sirt1 determine the cancerous function of CircHULC 
dependent on autophagy.
CONCLUSIONS: we shed light on the fact that the targeted attenuation of 
deregulated functioning of CircHULC could be a viable approach for cancer 
treatment, and CircHULC may acts as the potential biomarker and therapeutic

cell membrane structure and function, hormone synthesis, and the regulation of

United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) database, then validate potential 
inhibitory compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in cis- and trans-cleavage

database identified 10 compounds with highest site-moiety map scores. Compound 
NSC89640 (coded C1) showed marked inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 
Mpro in cis-/trans-cleavage assays. C1 strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 Mpro 
enzymatic activity, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 
2.69 μM and a selectivity index (SI) of >74.35. The C1 structure served as a 
template to identify structural analogs based on AtomPair fingerprints to refine 
and verify structure-function associations. Mpro-mediated cis-/trans-cleavage 
assays conducted with the structural analogs revealed that compound NSC89641

excellent anticancer effects, but its exact anticancer mechanism is still 
unclear.
METHODS: CCK8, EdU, and flow cytometry assay were performed to detect the effect 
of ORI on cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. RNA-seq was 
carried out to search the underlying mechanisms. Total PKM2, dimeric PKM2, 
nuclear PKM2 was detected by Western blot. The epidermal growth factor 
receptor/extracellular signal regulated kinase (EGFR/ERK) signaling was assayed. 
The binding ability of Importin-α5 to PKM2 was performed by Co-IP experiments. 
The effect of ORI combined with cysteine (Cys) or fructose-1, 6-diphosphate 
(FDP) on cancer cells was detected. Mouse xenograft model was established to 
confirm the molecular mechanisms in vivo.
RESULTS: ORI inhibited viability, proliferation and promoted apoptosis of CRC 
cells. RNA-seq revealed ORI attenuated the Warburg effect in cancer cells. ORI 
reduced dimeric PKM2 and prevented it from entering the nucleus. ORI did not 
affect the EGFR/ERK signaling, but reduced Importin-α5 binding to the PKM2 
dimer. Cys or FDP reversed or enhanced the effect of ORI. Animal model assay 
confirmed the molecular mechanisms in vivo.

adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer. Recently, 
AGRN is considered playing an vital role in the development of some cancers. 
However, the regulatory effects and mechanisms of AGRN in LUAD remain elusive. 
In this study, we clarified the significant upregulation of AGRN expression in 
LUAD by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with immunohistochemistry. Besides, 
we confirmed that LUAD patients with high AGRN expression are more susceptible 
to lymph node metastases and have a worse prognosis by a retrospective study of 
120 LUAD patients. Next, we demonstrated that AGRN directly interact with 
NOTCH1, which results in the release of the intracellular structural domain of 
NOTCH1 and the subsequent activation of the NOTCH pathway. Moreover, we also 
found that AGRN promotes proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and 
tumorigenesis of LUAD cells in vitro and in vivo, and that these effects are 
reversed by blocking the NOTCH pathway. Furthermore, we prepared several 
antibodies targrting AGRN, and clarify that Anti-AGRN antibody treatment could

types can shape numerous biological outcomes.Many studies have documented 
instances of reciprocal communication between fibroblasts and cancer cells that 
functionally change cancer cell behavior. However, less is known about how these 
heterotypic interactions shape epithelial cell function in the absence of 
oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, fibroblasts are prone to undergo 
senescence, which is typified by an irreversible cell cycle arrest. Senescent 
fibroblasts are also known to secrete various cytokines into the extracellular 
space; a phenomenon that is termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP). While the role of fibroblast derived SASP factors on cancer cells has 
been well studied, the impact of these factors on normal epithelial cells 
remains poorly understood. We discovered that treatment of normal mammary 
epithelial cells with conditioned media (CM) from senescent fibroblasts (SASP 
CM) results in a caspase-dependent cell death. This capacity of SASP CM to cause 
cell death is maintained across multiple senescence-inducing stimuli. However, 
the activation of oncogenic signaling in mammary epithelial cells mitigates the 
ability of SASP CM to induce cell death. Despite the reliance of this cell death 
on caspase activation, we discovered that SASP CM does not cause cell death by 
the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Instead, these cells die by an 
NLRP3, caspase-1, and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent induction of pyroptosis. 
Taken together, our findings reveal that senescent fibroblasts can cause 
pyroptosis in neighboring mammary epithelial cells, which has implications for 
therapeutic strategies that perturb the behavior of senescent cells.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104922

been used as a tonic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for years. Based on its 
meridian tropism in liver, spleen, and lung, PJ was popularly used to enhance 
the function of these organs. It is originally recorded with detoxicant effect 
on binge drink in Ben Cao Gang Mu Shi Yi, a persuasive Chinese materia medica. 
And binge dink has a close relationship with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). 
Hence, it's meaningful to investigate whether PJ exerts liver protection against 
binge drink toxicity.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation was carried out not only to emphasize the 
right recognition of total saponins from PJ (SPJ), but also to study on its 
sober-up effectiveness and defensive mechanism against acute alcoholic liver 
injury in vivo and in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPJ constituents were verified by HPLC-UV analysis. In 
vivo, acute alcoholic liver oxidative stress and hepatosteatosis were 
established by continuous ethanol gavage to C57BL/6 mice for 3 days. SPJ was 
pre-administered for 7 days to investigate its protective efficacy. Loss of 
righting reflex (LORR) assay was employed to assess anti-inebriation effect of 
SPJ. Transaminases levels and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were measured 
to indicate the alcoholic liver injury. Antioxidant enzymes were measured to 
evaluate the oxidative stress degree in liver. Measurement of hepatic lipid 
accumulation was based on Oil Red O staining. Levels of inflammatory cytokines 
were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vitro, HepG2 
cells were treated with ethanol for 24 h, and SPJ was pre-administered for 2 h. 
2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used as a probe to indicate 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nrf2 activation was verified by the 
favor of specific inhibitor, ML385. The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was 
indicated with immunofluorescence analysis. Proteins expressions of related 
pathways were determined by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Oleanane-type saponins are the most abundant constituents of SPJ. In 
this acute model, SPJ released inebriation of mice in a dose dependent manner. 
It decreased levels of serum ALT and AST, and hepatic TG. Besides, SPJ inhibited 
CYP2E1 expression and reduced MDA level in liver, with upregulations of 
antioxidant enzymes GSH, SOD and CAT. p62-related Nrf2 pathway was activated by 
SPJ with downstream upregulations of GCLC and NQO1 in liver. AMPK-ACC/PPARα axis 
was upregulated by SPJ to alleviate hepatic lipidosis. Hepatic IL-6 and TNF-α 
levels were downregulated by SPJ, which indicated a regressive lipid 
peroxidation in liver. In HepG2 cells, SPJ reduced ethanol-exposed ROS 
generation. Activated p62-related Nrf2 pathway was verified to contribute to the 
alleviation of alcohol-induced oxidative stress in hepatic cells.
CONCLUSION: This attenuation of hepatic oxidative stress and steatosis suggested 
the therapeutic value of SPJ for ALD.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2023.116785

for developing countries. Oxidative stress plays an important role in cancer 
initiation, progression, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. 
For this reason, one of the important strategic targets of new cancer 
therapeutics is to drive cancer cells into apoptosis through oxidative stress. 
In nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and gamma-H2AX 
(γ-H2AX) are used as important oxidative stress biomarkers. Fusaric acid (FA) is 
a mycotoxin that mediates toxicity produced by Fusarium species and exhibits 
anticancer effects in various cancers via inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, 
or other cellular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to determine the effects 
of fusaric acid on cytotoxic and oxidative damage in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell 
lines. In this context, dose and time dependent cytotoxic effect of fusaric acid 
was determined by XTT method, mRNA expression levels of genes related to DNA 
repair were determined by RT-PCR, and its effect on 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 
and γ-H2AX levels was revealed by ELISA assay. According to XTT results, fusaric 
acid inhibits cell proliferation in MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells in a dose- and 
time-dependent manner. IC50 doses were determined as 187.74 μM at 48 h in MIA 
PaCa-2 cells and 134.83 μM at 48 h in PANC-1 cells, respectively. γ-H2AX and 
8-OHdG changes were not found significant in pancreatic cancer cells. The mRNA 
expression levels of DNA repair-related genes NEIL1, OGG1, XRCC and Apex-1 
change with exposure to fusaric acid. This study contributes to the therapeutic 
approaches to be developed for pancreatic cancer and demonstrates the potential 
of fusaric acid as an anticancer agent.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.toxicon.2023.107179

Tr1 cells exhibited the capacity to convert to DN and DP Tr1 cells, indicative 
of plasticity between these populations. Together, these data determine the

adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix (AIS). We aimed to evaluate the 
relationship between the excisional specimen dimensions and the endocervical 
margin status.
METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective study in seven French 
centers. All cases with proven AIS on a colposcopic biopsy and undergoing an 
excisional procedure afterwards were included in the analysis. We evaluated the 
impact of excision length, along with the lateral and anteroposterior diameters 
on the endocervical margin status. An additional subgroup analysis of the impact 
of maternal age on endocervical margin status was also conducted.
RESULTS: Of the 101 cases of AIS diagnosed on initial biopsy, 95 underwent a 
primary excisional procedure, among which 80% (n=76/95) had uninvolved 
endocervical margins and 20% (n=19/95) had positive endocervical margins. The 
excisional specimen length was not significantly related to the endocervical 
margin status. Conversely, both lateral and antero-posterior diameters were 
significantly correlated with the negative endocervical margins status: 
OR = 1,19, 95% CI [1.03, 1.40], p=0.025, for the lateral diameter and OR = 1.34, 
95% CI [1.14, 1.64], p=0.001 for the antero-posterior diameter. The median 
lateral diameter was 20 mm, IQR (18, 24) in case of endocervical negative 
margins vs. 18 mm IQR (15, 24) in case of positive endocervical margins 
(p=0.039), and the median anteroposterior diameter was 17 mm IQR (15, 20) in 
case of negative endocervical margins vs 14 mm IQR (11, 15) in case of positive 
endocervical margins (p=0.004), respectively.  Additionally, in patients over 45 
years old, endocervical margin were more likely to be positive despite similar 
excisional dimensions (7/17 (41%) of positive endocercival margins before 45 
years old vs 12/78 (15%) after, p = 0.039) CONCLUSIONS: Endocervical margin 
statues were significantly related to the transverse diameters (lateral and 
anteroposterior diameters), but not to the excision specimen length. Reducing 
the excised length may lead to fewer post-procedure complications but would 
still allow to obtain a large proportion of negative endocervical margins.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jogoh.2023.102622

thromboxane A2 signaling has been greatly extended. From humble beginnings as a 
short-lived stimulus that activates platelets and causes vasoconstriction to a 
dichotomous receptor system involving multiple endogenous ligands capable of 
modifying tissue homeostasis and disease generation in almost every tissue of 
the body. Thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) signal transduction is associated with 
the pathogenesis of cancer, atherosclerosis, heart disease, asthma, and host 
response to parasitic infection amongst others. The two receptors mediating 
these cellular responses (TPα and TPβ) are derived from a single gene (TBXA2R) 
through alternative splicing. Recently, knowledge about the mechanism(s) of 
signal propagation by the two receptors has undergone a revolution in 
understanding. Not only have the structural relationships associated with 
G-protein coupling been established but the modulation of that signaling by 
post-translational modification to the receptor has come sharply into focus. 
Moreover, the signaling of the receptor unrelated to G-protein coupling has 
become a burgeoning field of endeavor with over 70 interacting proteins 
currently identified. These data are reshaping the concept of TP signaling from 
a mere guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Gα activation to a nexus for the 
convergence of diverse and poorly characterized signaling pathways. This review 
summarizes the advances in understanding in TP signaling, and the potential for 
new growth in a field that after almost 50 years is finally coming of age.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2023.108478

vaccinated immunocompromised patients (n=58), healthy seronegative naive 
controls (NC, n=8), and healthy seropositive vaccinated controls (VC, n=32) by 
Luminex, spike-induced IFN-γ Elispot and an IDT. A skin biopsy 24h after IDT and 
single-cell RNAseq was performed in three vaccinated volunteers.
RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of seronegative NC had a positive Elispot (2/8) and 
IDT (1/4), compared to 95% (20/21) and 93% (28/30) in seropositive VC, 
respectively. Single-cell RNAseq data in the skin of VC showed a predominant 
mixed population of effector helper and cytotoxic T cells. The TCR repertoire 
revealed 18/1064 clonotypes with known specificities against SARS-CoV-2, among 
which six were spike-specific. Seronegative immunocompromised patients with 
positive Elispot and IDT were in 83% (5/6) treated with B cell-depleting 
reagents, while those with negative IDT were all transplant recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that delayed local reaction to IDT reflects 
vaccine-induced T-cell immunity opening new perspectives to monitor seronegative 
patients and elderly populations with waning immunity.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jinf.2023.06.005

produced by NF-κB activation. Under normal pathophysiologic conditions, proper 
signaling by these NLRs protect against potential autoimmune responses. These 
NLRs associate with several different proteins within both the canonical and 
noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways to either prevent activation of the 
pathway or inhibit signal transduction. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathways 
ultimately dampens the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation 
of other downstream pro-inflammatory signaling mechanisms. Dysregulation of 
these NLRs, including NLRC3, NLRX1, and NLRP12, have been reported in human 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer patients, suggesting the 
potential of these NLRs as biomarkers for disease detection. Mouse models 
deficient in these NLRs also have increased susceptibility to colitis and

for endometriosis in the United States.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement 
Program (NSQIP) database from 2012-2020.
PATIENTS: Patients with endometriosis diagnosis.
INTERVENTIONS: Laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared women with and without 30-day 
post-operative major complications, defined according to the Clavien-Dindo 
classification. 28,697 women underwent minimally invasive surgery during the 
study period, of which 2.6% had major post-operative complications. Organ space 
surgical site infection and reoperation were the most common complications 
(47.0% and 39.8%, respectively). In multivariable regression analysis, African 
American race [aOR 95%CI 1.61 (1.29-2.01), p<0.001], hypertension [aOR 95%CI 
1.23 (1.01-1.50), p=0.036], bleeding disorders [aOR 95%CI 1.96 (1.03-3.74), 
p=0.041], bowel procedures [aOR 95%CI 1.93 (1.37-2.72), p<0.001] and 
hysterectomy [aOR 95%CI 2.09 (1.67-2.63), p<0.001] were independently associated 
with increased risk of major complications. In multivariable regression analysis 
of laparoscopies without bowel procedures, African American race, bleeding 
disorders and hysterectomy were independently associated with increased major 
complication risk. Among cases with bowel procedures, African American race and 
colectomy were independently associated with increased major complication risk. 
In multivariable regression analysis of women who underwent hysterectomy, 
African American race, bleeding disorders and lysis of adhesions were 
independently associated with increased major complications risk. Among women 
who underwent a uterine-sparing surgery, African American race, hypertension, 
preoperative blood transfusion and bowel procedures were independently 
associated with increased major complications risk.
CONCLUSION: Among women undergoing minimally invasive surgery for endometriosis, 
African American race, hypertension, bleeding disorders and bowel surgery or 
hysterectomy are risk factors for major complications. African American race is 
a risk factor for major complications among women undergoing surgeries with and 
without bowel procedures or hysterectomy.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jmig.2023.06.002

MitoQ) was shown to be an effective antimetastatic drug in patients with 
triple-negative breast cancer. MitoQ, sold as a nutritional supplement, prevents 
breast cancer recurrence. It potently inhibited tumor growth and tumor cell 
proliferation in preclinical xenograft models and in vitro breast cancer cells. 
The proposed mechanism of action involves the inhibition of reactive oxygen 
species by MitoQ via a redox-cycling mechanism between the oxidized form, MitoQ, 
and the fully reduced form, MitoQH2 (also called Mito-ubiquinol). To fully 
corroborate this antioxidant mechanism, we substituted the hydroquinone group 
(-OH) with the methoxy group (-OCH3). Unlike MitoQ, the modified form, dimethoxy 
MitoQ (DM-MitoQ), lacks redox-cycling between the quinone and hydroquinone 
forms. DM-MitoQ was not converted to MitoQ in MDA-MB-231 cells. We tested the 
antiproliferative effects of both MitoQ and DM-MitoQ in human breast cancer 
(MDA-MB-231), brain-homing cancer (MDA-MB-231BR), and glioma (U87MG) cells. 
Surprisingly, DM-MitoQ was slightly more potent than MitoQ (IC50 = 0.26 μM 
versus 0.38 μM) at inhibiting proliferation of these cells. Both MitoQ and 
DM-MitoQ potently inhibited mitochondrial complex I-dependent oxygen consumption 
(IC50 = 0.52 μM and 0.17 μM, respectively). This study also suggests that 
DM-MitoQ, which is a more hydrophobic analog of MitoQ (logP: 10.1 and 8.7) 
devoid of antioxidant function and reactive oxygen species scavenging ability, 
can inhibit cancer cell proliferation. We conclude that inhibition of 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by MitoQ is responsible for inhibition 
of breast cancer and glioma proliferation and metastasis. Blunting the 
antioxidant effect using the redox-crippled DM-MitoQ can serve as a useful 
negative control in corroborating the involvement of free radical-mediated 
processes (e.g., ferroptosis, protein oxidation/nitration) using MitoQ in other 
oxidative pathologies.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2023.06.009

METHODS: I have analyzed Max Verworn's writings on the description of the

RESULTS: Verworn introduced a precursor of the sufficient component cause model 
as early as 1912, possibly inspired by Ernst Mach. He argued for the abandonment 
of the concept of ""cause"" (singular). Instead, he preferred the term 
""conditions"". Unlike Karl Pearson, Verworn was not opposed to causal 
considerations. However, according to Verworn, every process or state is 
determined by numerous conditions and not by a single factor or ""cause"". Instead 
of speaking of causalism, Verworn preferred to speak of conditionalism.

(RC), requiring additional procedures in 10% of patients1. This results from 
loss of level I and II vaginal support due to removal of pelvic structures. In 
addition, a neobladder urinary diversion, with Valsalva voiding, predisposes to 
vaginal prolapse. Genital sparing approach with paravaginal repair can help 
prevent such complication.
METHODS & TECHNIQUE: Genital sparing technique preserves the uterus, fallopian 
tubes, ovaries, and vagina, while paravaginal repair involves suturing of the 
lateral vaginal wall to the arcuate fascia located on the medial aspect of the 
obturator internus muscle. Procedure begins by placing the patient in lithotomy 
position, with a steep Trendelenburg. Standard 6 port cystectomy configuration 
is utilized with an additional 15 mm port for bowel anastomosis. Initially the 
ureters and lateral bladder space is mobilized. Posteriorly a dissection plane 
is developed separating the bladder from the anterior vaginal wall. Distal 
dissection is carefully performed in that plane to avoid disrupting 
urethral-external sphincter complex. Then the bladder is dropped from anterior 
attachments, the DVC and bladder neck are exposed. Urethra is transected distal 
to bladder neck, after circumferential mobilization, to complete the cystectomy, 
again avoiding disruption of continence mechanism and opening the endo-pelvic 
fascia. Cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissected are completed in standard 
fashion. The arcuate fascia is identified bilaterally for level I paravaginal 
repair. The lateral aspect of the paravaginal tissue is secured to this 
ligament, using 3 interrupted PDS sutures, bilaterally. An ileal ""Hautman's W 
pouch"" neobladder is constructed using 50cm of small intestine, similar to the 
previously reported technique2. Bricker-type uretero-ileal anastomosis is 
performed over a double J stent. Bowel continuity is restored by a side-to-side 
anastomosis using endo-GIA staplers.
RESULTS: No intra- or post-operative complications were noted. Robot dock-time 
was 8 hours and 23 minutes with EBL of 100mL. Patient was discharged on POD 6 
and Foley-catheter with ureteral stents were removed on POD 27 after a cystogram 
confirming no leaks. At 6-month follow-up, patient reported good continence 
using a single pad, voiding every 3-4hours. Fluoro-urodynamics demonstrated 651 
mL capacity, low-pressure voiding, minimal residual urine, and no reflux. No 
prolapse was noted on fluoroscopy and pelvic exam with Valsalva maneuver. 
Patient reported good satisfaction level, regarding her urinary symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: We report satisfactory short-term outcomes of a feasible technique 
to prevent post-cystectomy prolapse, however long-term follow-up of a larger 
cohort, can help establish its efficacy.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.urology.2023.05.031

non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that affects the brain, eyes, cerebrospinal fluid, or

oncoprotein binds to ERBB3-ERBB2 heterodimers and activates downstream 
signaling, supporting a therapeutic approach for inhibiting ERBB3/ERBB2. 
However, the frequency and clinicopathological features of solid tumors 
harboring NRG1 fusions in Korean patients remain largely unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed archival data from next-generation sequencing 
panel tests conducted at a single institution, specifically selecting patients 
with in-frame fusions that preserved the functional domain. The 
clinicopathological characteristics of patients harboring NRG1 fusions were 
retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Out of 8,148 patients, NRG1 fusions were identified in 22 patients 
(0.27%). The average age of the patients was 59 years (range, 32-78 years), and 
the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.2. The lung was the most frequently observed 
primary site (n=13), followed by the pancreaticobiliary tract (n=3), 
gastrointestinal tract (n=2, stomach and rectum each), ovary (n=2), breast 
(n=1), and soft tissue (n=1). Histologically, all tumors demonstrated 
adenocarcinoma histology, with the exception of one case of sarcoma. CD74 (n=8) 
and SLC3A2 (n=4) were the most frequently identified fusion partners. Dominant 
features included the presence of fewer than three co-occurring genetic 
alterations, a low tumor mutation burden, and low programmed death-ligand 1 
expression. Various clinical responses were observed in patients with NRG1 
fusions.
CONCLUSION: Despite the rarity of NRG1 fusions in Korean patients with solid 
tumors, identification through next-generation sequencing enables the 
possibility of new targeted therapies.","DOI: 10.4143/crt.2023.682

with potentially severe effects especially in particle therapy (PT). If 
compensation strategies are not applied, accuracy cannot be achieved. To support 
the clinical practice based on 4D Computed Tomography (CT), 4D Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions can be exploited. The purpose of this study 
was to validate a method for virtual 4DCT generation from 4DMRI data for lung 
cancers on a porcine lung phantom, and to apply it to lung cancer patients in 
PT.&#xD;Approach: Deformable image registration was used to register each 
respiratory phase of the 4DMRI to a reference phase. Then, a static 3DCT was 
registered to this reference MR image set, and the virtual 4DCT was generated by 
warping the registered CT according to previously obtained deformation fields. 
The method was validated on a physical phantom for which a ground truth 4DCT was 
available and tested on lung tumor patients, treated with gated PT at 
end-exhale, by comparing the virtual 4DCT with a re-evaluation 4DCT. The 
geometric and dosimetric evaluation was performed for both proton and carbon ion 
treatment plans.&#xD;Main results: The phantom validation exhibited a 
geometrical accuracy within the maximum resolution of the MRI and mean dose 
deviations, with respect to the prescription dose, up to 3.2% for target D95%, 
with a mean gamma pass rate of 98%. For patients, the virtual and re-evaluation 
4DCTs showed good correspondence, with errors on target D95% up to 2% within the 
gating window. For one patient, dose variations up to 10% at end-exhale were 
observed due to relevant inter-fraction anatomo-pathological changes that 
occurred between the planning and re-evaluation CTs. &#xD;Significance: Results 
obtained on phantom data showed that the virtual 4DCT method was accurate, 
allowing its application on patient data for testing within a clinical 
scenario.&#xD;&#xD.",Creative Commons Attribution license.,"DOI: 10.1088/1361-6560/acdec5

centres certified by the German Cancer Society (DKG) resulting in underuse of 
these facilities and inferior oncological treatment. One way to address this 
issue would be to restructure the healthcare landscape by following the Danish 
approach that limits cancer treatment to specialized hospitals. Such an approach 
would have an impact on the travelling times to treatment centers. The present 
study determines the impact on patient travel times using the example of 
colorectal cancer.
METHODS: For the present analysis, data from structured quality reports (sQB) 
and from patients insured with the AOK who underwent resection of the colon or 
rectum during 2018 were used. In addition, data from the DKG regarding an 
existing certification of a colorectal cance centre were used. Travel time was 
defined as the time patients spent in an average car with average traffic from 
the midpoint of the ZIP code of their residence to the coordinates of the 
hospital. The coordinates of the hospitals and the midpoints of the ZIP codes 
were obtained by querying the Google API. Travel times were calculated with a 
local Open Routing Machine server. The statistical programs R and Stata were 
used for analyses and cartographic representations.
RESULTS: In 2018, nearly half of all patients with colon cancer were treated at 
the hospital nearest to their place of residence, of whom approximately 40% were 
treated at a certified colorectal cancer centre. Overall, only about 47% of all 
treatments took place at a certified colorectal cancer centre. Travel time to 
the chosen treatment site averaged 20 minutes. It was minimally shorter 
(18 minutes) if no certified centre was chosen and minimally longer (21 minutes) 
for those whose treatment took place in a certified colorectal cancer centre. 
Modeling of redistributions of all patients to certified centres resulted in a 
maximum travel time of 29 minutes.
CONCLUSION: Even if treatment were limited to specialized hospitals, treatment 
close to home would still be guaranteed. Regardless of certification, parallel 
structures can be identified, especially in metropolitan areas, which indicate a 
potential for restructuring.","Publisher: EINLEITUNG: Der deutschen Krankenhauslandschaft mangelt es an einer 
gezielten Versorgungssteuerung, was u. a. an der unzureichenden Nutzung von 
durch die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft (DKG) zertifizierten Krebszentren zu 
erkennen ist. So werden allzu viele Patient*innen außerhalb von Krebszentren und 
damit schlechter behandelt. Um dem zu begegnen, könnte die Behandlung in 
Anlehnung an Dänemark auf spezialisierte Krankenhäuser begrenzt werden und die 
vorliegende Studie ermittelt die Auswirkungen auf die Fahrzeiten von 
Patient*innen am Beispiel des kolorektalen Karzinoms.
METHODEN: Die Analysen für das Jahr 2018 basieren auf Daten der strukturierten 
Qualitätsberichte (sQB) und von bei der AOK versicherten Patient*innen, bei 
denen eine Resektion des Kolons oder Rektums erfolgt ist. Darüber hinaus wurden 
Angaben der DKG bezüglich einer vorhandenen Zertifizierung eines 
Darmkrebszentrums genutzt. Die Fahrzeit wurde definiert als Zeit, die 
Patient*innen mit einem durchschnittlichen PKW bei durchschnittlichem Verkehr 
vom Mittelpunkt der Postleitzhal (PLZ) ihres Wohnorts zu den Koordinaten des 
Krankenhauses benötigen. Die Koordinaten der Krankenhäuser und die Mittelpunkte 
der PLZ wurden über eine Abfrage der Google API ermittelt. Die Berechnung der 
Fahrtzeiten wiederum erfolgte unter Zuhilfenahme eines lokalen Open Routing 
Machine Servers. Für die statistischen Analysen und kartographischen 
Darstellungen wurden die Statistikprogramme R und Stata verwendet.
ERGEBNISSE: In 2018 wurde fast die Hälfte aller Patient*innen mit Kolonkarzinom 
im nächstgelegenen Krankenhaus behandelt, wobei davon ca. 40% in einem 
zertifizierten Darmkrebszentrum behandelt wurden. Insgesamt fanden nur ca. 47% 
aller Behandlungen in einem zertifizierten Darmkrebszentrum statt. Die Fahrtzeit 
zum gewählten Behandlungsort lag insgesamt bei durchschnittlich 20 Minuten. Sie 
war etwas geringer (18 Minuten), wenn kein zertifiziertes Zentrum gewählt wurde, 
und etwas länger (21 Minuten) für diejenigen, deren Behandlung in einem 
zertifizierten Darmkrebszentrum stattfand. Die Modellierungen von Umverteilungen 
aller Patient*innen nur zu zertifizierten Zentren ergab eine maximale Fahrtzeit 
von 29 Minuten.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Bei einer Steuerung der Behandlung hin zu spezialisierten 
Krankenhäusern wäre eine wohnortnahe Behandlung weiterhin gewährleistet. 
Unabhängig von einer Zertifizierung lassen sich besonders in Ballungsgebieten 
Parallelstrukturen erkennen, die auf ein Umstrukturierungspotential hinweisen.","The Author(s). This is an open access article published by Thieme under the

nanoparticles (SFNPs) with uniform particles size, and then modify the SFNPs 
with nanobody 11C12 targeting the proximal membrane end of CEA on the surface of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The regenerated silk fibroin (SF) was isolated 
using ultrafiltration tubes with a 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off, and the 
retention fraction (named as SF > 50 kDa) was further self-assembled into SFNPs 
by ethanol induction. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution 
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) showed that the SFNPs with uniform 
particles size were formed. Due to electrostatic adsorption and pH 
responsiveness, SFNPs have been proved to effectively load and release the 
anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX)（DOX@SFNPs). Further, targeting 
molecule nanobody 11C12 was used to modify these nanoparticles, constituting the 
targeted outer layer of the drug delivery system（DOX@SFNPs-11C12), achieving 
precise localization to cancer cells. The release amount of DOX observed from in 
vitro drug release profiles increased as follows: pH 7.4 < pH 6.8 < pH 5.4, 
demonstrating that the DOX release could be accelerated in a weakly acidic 
environment. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments displayed that SFNPs-11C12 
nanoparticles exhibited good safety and biocompatibility. Drug-loaded 
nanoparticles, DOX@SFNPs-11C12, led to higher LoVo cells apoptosis compared to 
DOX@SFNPs. Fluorescence spectrophotometer characterization and Confocal laser 
scanning microscopy (CLSM) further showed that the internalization of DOX was 
highest in the DOX@SFNPs-11C12, certifying that the introduced targeting 
molecule enhanced the uptake of drug delivery system by LoVo cells. This study 
provides a simple and operational approach to developing an optimized SFNPs drug 
delivery system modified by targeting nanobody, which can be a good candidate 
for CRC therapy.&#xD.",© 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1088/1748-605X/acdeba

chimeric protein binds to PD-L1 and at picomolar concentration induces its

use, the exploration of CAM integration into oncology treatments is becoming 
increasingly prevalent. Antioxidants have been proposed as potentially 
beneficial to prevent or treat cancer. However, evidence summaries are limited, 
and the United States Preventive Services Task Force has recently recommended 
the use of Vitamin C and E supplementation for cancer prevention. Thus, the 
objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the existing literature on 
the safety and efficacy of antioxidant supplementation in oncology patients.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, using prespecified 
search terms in PubMed and CINAHL. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, 
abstracts, and full-text articles, with a third reviewer resolving conflicts, 
before the included articles underwent data extraction and quality appraisal.
RESULTS: Twenty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Of the included 
studies, nine evaluated selenium, eight evaluated Vitamin C, four evaluated 
Vitamin E, and three of these studies included a combination of two or more of 
these agents. The most frequently evaluated cancer types included colorectal 
cancer (n = 4), leukemias (n = 4), breast cancer (n = 3), and genitourinary 
cancers (n = 3). Most of the studies focused on the antioxidants' therapeutic 
efficacy (n = 15) or their use in protecting against chemotherapy- or 
radiation-induced side effects (n = 8), and one study evaluated the role of an 
antioxidant in protection against cancer. Findings were generally favorable 
among the studies, and adverse effects of supplementation were limited. 
Furthermore, the average score for all the included articles on the Mixed 
Methods Appraisal Tool was 4.2, indicating the high quality of the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidant supplements may provide benefits in reducing incidence 
or severity of treatment-induced side effects with limited risk for adverse 
effects. Large, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these 
findings among various cancer diagnoses and stages. Healthcare providers should 
understand the safety and efficacy of these therapies to address questions that 
arise in caring for those with cancer.","DOI: 10.1177/10781552231182362

important goal following the endoprosthetic reconstruction. The objective of 
this study was to assess the functional outcome after endoprosthetic 
reconstruction for tumors around the knee and to explore prognostic factors of 
functional outcome.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on patients who underwent tumor 
prosthetic replacements consecutively. Musculoskeletal Tumour Society score and 
Toronto Extremity Salvage Score were used to assess the functional outcome at 1, 
3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The logistic model was used to select 
factors that had potential predictive value for postoperative function. 
Potential prognostic factors included age, gender, tumor site, type of tumor, 
length of bone resection, type of prosthesis, length of prosthetic stem, 
chemotherapy, pathological fracture, and body mass index.
RESULTS: At the 24 months after surgery, the mean musculoskeletal tumor society 
(MSTS) score was 81.4% and the mean Toronto extremity salvage score (TESS) was 
83.6%. At the last follow-up, 68% of patients and 73% of patients received 
perfect or good MSTS score and TESS score, respectively. The multivariate 
analysis according to ordered-logit model showed that age < 35 years, distal 
femoral prosthesis, and length of bone resection < 14 cm were independent 
prognostic factors of better functional outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoprosthetic reconstruction may provide good functional results 
for most patients. Younger patients with distal femoral prosthesis and shorter 
resection of bone (on the premise of complete resection of tumor) are more 
likely to obtain satisfactory functional results after surgery.","DOI: 10.1177/15330338231181283

important role in the treatment of malignant tumors, is increasing. Although 
rarely observed, neurological immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated 
with ICIs result in high morbidity and mortality. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
is a common cause of neurological paraneoplastic syndromes (PNSs). The 
differentiation between PNSs and neurological irAEs is important in patients 
using ICIs. Cerebellar ataxia caused by atezolizumab is a rare irAE.
CASE REPORT: In this context, we present a 66-year-old man with SCLC who 
developed immune-mediated cerebellar ataxia after three cycles of atezolizumab, 
a programmed cell death ligand-1 inhibitor. The admission brain and spinal 
gadolinium-based contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) supported 
the preliminary diagnosis and indicated leptomeningeal involvement. However, the 
blood tests and a lumbar puncture did not reveal any structural, biochemical, 
paraneoplastic, or infectious cause. Management and outcome of high-dose steroid 
treatment resulted in an improvement in the radiological involvement, as 
evidenced both clinically and on follow-up whole spine MRI. Therefore, the 
immunotherapy was discontinued. The patient was discharged on day 20 without 
neurological sequelae.
DISCUSSION: In light of this, we present this case to emphasize the differential 
diagnosis of neurological irAEs originating from ICIs, which require rapid 
diagnosis and treatment, and clinically similar PNSs and radiologically similar 
leptomeningeal involvement, in the case of SCLC.","DOI: 10.1177/10781552231180594

geriatric assessment and management changes outcomes in older cancer patients, 
notably allowing decreased treatment toxicity, better treatment completion, and 
increased functional outcomes. In GI cancers and breast cancer, several recent 
studies have addressed when treatment intensity can be decreased, and when not. 
New treatments for Acute Myeloid Leukemia are finally beginning to improve 
outcomes for older patients and such patients should be referred to oncologists 
for management. In prostate cancer, new imaging techniques (e.g. PSMA scan) and 
treatment options can allow better treatment targeting and spare some hormonal 
and chemotherapy toxicity. Finally, we review recent public policy efforts to 
address the epidemiologic wave of cancer in older patients on a global scale.","S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000531559

endometrial cancers (EC) into pathology reporting and clinical management, 
uptake is inconsistent. To assign ProMisE subtype, all molecular components must 
be available (POLE mutation status, mismatch repair (MMR) and p53 
immunohistochemistry (IHC)) and often these are assessed at different stages of 
care and/or at different centres resulting in delays in treatment. We assessed a 
single-test DNA-based targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) molecular 
classifier (ProMisE NGS), comparing concordance and prognostic value to the 
original ProMisE classifier.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) ECs that 
had previously undergone ProMisE molecular classification (POLE sequencing, IHC 
for p53 and MMR). DNA was sequenced using the clinically validated Imagia 
Canexia Health Find It™ amplicon-based NGS gene panel assay to assess for 
pathogenic POLE mutations (unchanged from original ProMisE), TP53 mutations (in 
lieu of p53 IHC), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (in lieu of MMR IHC),with 
the same order of segregation as original ProMisE used for subtype assignment. 
Molecular subtype assignment of both classifiers was compared by concordance 
metrics and Kaplan-Meier survival statistics.
RESULTS: The new DNA-based NGS molecular classifier (ProMisE NGS) was used to 
determine the molecular subtype in 164 ECs previously classified with ProMisE. 
159/164 cases were concordant with a kappa statistic of 0.96 and an overall 
accuracy of 0.97. Prognostic differences in progression-free, disease-specific 
and overall survival between the four molecular subtypes were observed for the 
new NGS classifier, recapitulating the survival curves of the original ProMisE 
classifier. ProMisE NGS was 100% concordant between matched biopsy and 
hysterectomy samples.
CONCLUSION: ProMisE NGS is feasible on standard FFPE material, demonstrates high 
concordance with the original ProMisE classifier and maintains prognostic value 
in EC. This test has the potential to facilitate implementation of molecular 
classification of EC at the time of first diagnosis.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.05.073

success rate of intraoperative injection of radiotracer and blue dye performed 
by the surgeon without the use of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for the 
detection of sentinel lymph nodes in clinically early stage vulvar cancer.
METHODS: All patients with clinically early stage vulvar cancer who underwent 
attempted sentinel lymph node biopsy using intraoperative injection of 
Technetium-99 m (99mTc) tracer and blue dye performed by the surgeon after 
induction of anesthesia at single academic institution from 12/2009 to 5/2022 
were identified. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables were collected. 
Data were compared using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four patients (median age 66.4 years) underwent 
intraoperative injection of radioactive tracer and dye for sentinel lymph node 
biopsy. Most patients (n = 156, 95.1%) were white. Squamous cell carcinoma 
accounted for 138 cases (84.1%), melanoma for 10 (6.1%), extra-mammary invasive 
Paget's disease for 11 (6.7%), and other histologies for 5 (3%). A majority of 
cases were stage I disease on final pathology (n = 119, 72.6%). Most patients 
(n = 117, 71%) had tumors located within 2 cm of the midline and underwent 
planned bilateral groin assessment, while 47 (29%) had well lateralized lesions 
and underwent unilateral groin assessment. For the patients undergoing 
unilateral groin assessment, 44 of 47 (93.6%) had successful unilateral mapping. 
Of the patients who underwent bilateral groin assessment, 87 of 117 (74.4%) had 
successful bilateral mapping, and 26 of 117 (22.2%) had successful unilateral 
mapping. Of the 26 patients who underwent bilateral assessment but only had 
unilateral mapping, 19 had unilateral mapping to ipsilateral groin but failed 
contralateral mapping, six had midline lesions with successful mapping to one 
groin but failed mapping to the other groin, and one had unilateral mapping to 
the contralateral groin but not ipsilateral groin. The total successful sentinel 
lymph node mapping rate in this cohort was 86.5% (243/281 total sentinel lymph 
node attempts).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, the overall success rate of sentinel lymph node 
mapping and biopsy was 86.5%. The high rate of successful sentinel lymph node 
mapping supports the use of intraoperative radiotracer and blue dye injection by 
trained providers.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.05.067

carcinoma (2009 FIGO criteria) and applied the 2023 FIGO staging criteria to 
this population.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients who underwent cytoreduction for stage 
IVB endometrial carcinoma (2009 FIGO criteria) from 2014 to 2020 was performed. 
Demographics, clinicopathologic factors, and outcomes were recorded. Disease 
burden and distribution were determined by imaging, operative notes, and 
pathology reports. Patients were re-staged according to 2023 FIGO staging 
criteria. Categorical variables were compared using χ2 or Fisher's exact test, 
and Kaplan-Meier curves compared survival outcomes using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight cases were included. Most patients (63.6%) were not 
suspected to have stage IVB (2009 FIGO criteria) disease prior to surgery. 
Seventy-two percent of patients underwent primary cytoreduction, and 12 (19%) 
were suboptimal. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12 months (95% CI 
10-16 months), and median overall survival (OS) was 38 months (95% CI 
19-61 months). Degree of cytoreduction (p = 0.0101) and pelvic-confined 
metastatic disease (p = 0.0149) were significant prognostic factors, while 
distant metastases were not associated with worse outcomes. For those patients 
who underwent primary cytoreduction, number (p = 0.0453) and diameter 
(p = 0.0192) of tumor deposits were associated with PFS. When 2023 FIGO staging 
criteria were applied, 58% of patients underwent change in stage, and 8% did not 
meet criteria for complete staging. PFS was significantly different based on 
2023 FIGO staging (p = 0.0307); a trend in OS was also noted (p = 0.0550).
CONCLUSION: Stage IVB endometrial carcinoma (2009 FIGO criteria) encompasses a 
diverse cohort of patients, where certain clinicopathologic features, tumor 
burden, and degree of cytoreduction are associated with outcomes. The 2023 FIGO 
staging criteria significantly improves our ability to risk-stratify patients.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.05.069

nausea and vomiting (PONV) risk assessment tools in patients undergoing 
hepatectomy, and to guide healthcare professionals' assessment of postoperative 
patients.
BACKGROUND: The identification of PONV risk is particularly important in the 
context of prevention. However, the predictive performance of the current PONV 
risk scores has not been confirmed in patients with liver cancer, and its 
applicability is still unknown. These uncertainties pose difficulties in 
performing routine risk assessment of PONV for patients with liver cancer in a 
clinical practice setting.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with liver cancer and undergoing hepatectomy were 
prospectively consecutively recruited. All enrolled patients received PONV 
assessments and PONV risk assessments via the Apfel risk score and the 
Koivuranta risk score. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) and 
calibration curves were used to assess the external validity. This study was 
reported according to the TRIPOD Checklist.
RESULTS: Among 214 PONV-assessed patients, 114 patients (53.3%) developed PONV. 
For the Apfel simplified risk score, the ROC area was 0.612 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.543-0.678) in the validation dataset, which demonstrated 
imperfect discrimination; the calibration curve showed poor calibration with a 
slope of 0.49. For the Koivuranta score, the ROC area was 0.628 (CI: 
0.559-0.693) in the validation dataset, which showed limited discrimination; the 
calibration curve indicated an unsatisfactory calibration with a slope of 0.71.
CONCLUSIONS: The Apfel risk score and the Koivuranta risk score were not well 
validated in our study and disease-specific risk factors should be taken into 
account when updating or developing PONV risk stratification instruments.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejon.2023.102350

who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer and to determine the comprehensive 
risk factors contributing to psychosocial adjustment.
METHODS: This study was carried out on 358 young to middle-aged women who 
recently received a breast cancer diagnosis in two hospitals in Guangzhou, 
China. Participants reported data about sociodemographic characteristics, 
disease and treatment information, coping modes, social support, self-efficacy, 
and psychosocial adjustment. To analyze the data, the researchers utilized 
independent t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, and multiple linear 
regression.
RESULTS: The results showed that the participants exhibited a moderate level of 
psychosocial maladjustment, with a mean score of 42.44 ± 15.38. Additionally, 
30.4% of the participants were classified as having severe psychosocial 
maladjustment. The study identified the coping mode of acceptance-resignation 
(β = 0.367, P < 0.001), mode of avoidance (β = -0.248, P = 0.001), social 
support (β = -0.239, P < 0.001), self-efficacy (β = -0.199, P = 0.001) as 
factors that impacted the level of psychosocial adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial adjustment among young to middle-aged women who were 
newly diagnosed with breast cancer is affected by self-efficacy, social support, 
and coping modes. Healthcare professionals should pay attention to psychosocial 
adjustment in young to middle-aged women with breast cancer at the time of

quality of life, many patients with breast cancer in German-speaking countries 
opt for mistletoe therapy in addition to standard treatment. To understand the 
value for users, we evaluated the domain ""Patient and Social aspects"" in a 
health technology assessment on complementary mistletoe therapy in patients with 
breast cancer.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. 
Fifteen electronic databases and the internet were searched. Qualitative studies 
were analyzed using qualitative content analysis; quantitative studies were 
systematically summarized in evidence tables.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies out of 1203 screened publications with 4765 patients 
and 869 healthcare professionals were included in the review. The median 
proportion of patients using mistletoe therapy was 26.7% (range: 7.3-46.3%). 
Predictors for use were younger age and higher educational level. Main reasons 
for patients' use of mistletoe therapy were to leave nothing untried and to be 
actively involved in the treatment process. Reasons against use were related to 
a lack of knowledge or uncertainty regarding effectiveness and safety. 
Physicians mainly aimed to support the patient's physical condition as main 
reason for use and a lack of resources and knowledge as main reason against use.
CONCLUSION: Mistletoe therapy was commonly used in the treatment of breast 
cancer despite a lack of scientific knowledge among patients and physicians. 
Transparent communication on motivation for use and its potential effect enables 
realistic expectations. Relatively small samples of mistletoe therapy users 
limit the representativeness and validity of our results.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejon.2023.102338

qualitative research.
RESULTS: The review included 27 publications, with most research focusing on 
parents or primary caregivers. Five areas of information needs were identified: 
treatment, medication, and care; general information about cancer; coping and 
support; follow-up, late effects, and rehabilitation; and parenting and everyday

biomarker testing in one academic health system to identify current 
communication practices and unmet testing information needs.
METHODS: We conducted 1:1 in-depth interviews with 15 clinicians (i.e., nurses, 
oncologists, pathologists) and 12 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung 
cancer between January and May 2022. Participants described experiences with 
biomarker testing as well as associated communication practices and needs. 
Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Analysis was informed by the 
Framework Method.
RESULTS: Patients described challenges retaining information early in their 
patient journey. While patients were generally aware of biomarkers and their 
effect on treatment options, they expressed limited knowledge of expected time 
delays between testing and receiving results. Additionally, many did not know 
their testing results. Clinicians and patients both noted no standard education 
material on biomarker testing is currently available. They suggested such 
materials could support patient knowledge and decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: Communication between patients and clinicians about biomarker 
testing is largely delivered through verbal counseling at a time when patients 
may be cognitively compromised. All participants supported the idea of 
delivering standard, tangible education materials on biomarker testing to 
patients.

excessive cell proliferation and rapid tumor growth exceeding the oxygen supply, 
and can result in angiogenesis activation, increased invasiveness, 
aggressiveness, and metastasis, leading to improved tumor survival and 
suppression of anticancer drug therapeutic impact. SLC-0111, a ureido 
benzenesulfonamide, is a selective human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) IX inhibitor 
in clinical trials for the treatment of hypoxic malignancies. Herein, we 
describe the design and synthesis of novel 6-arylpyridines 8a-l and 9a-d as 
structural analogues of SLC-0111, in the aim of exploring new selective 
inhibitors for the cancer-associated hCA IX isoform. The para-fluorophenyl tail 
in SLC-0111 was replaced by the privileged 6-arylpyridine motif. Moreover, both 
ortho- and meta-sulfonamide regioisomers, as well as an ethylene extended 
analogous were developed. All 6-arylpyridine-based SLC-0111 analogues were 
screened in vitro for their inhibitory potential against a panel of hCAs (hCA I, 
II, IV and IX isoforms) using stopped-flow CO2 hydrase assay. In addition, the 
anticancer activity was firstly explored against a panel of 57 cancer cell lines 
at the USA NCI-Developmental Therapeutic Program. Compound 8g emerged as the 
best anti-proliferative candidate with mean GI% value equals 44. Accordingly, a 
cell viability assay (MTS) for 8g was applied on colorectal HCT-116 and HT-29 
cancer cell lines as well as on the healthy HUVEC cells. Thereafter, Annexin 
V-FITC apoptosis detection, cell cycle, TUNEL, and qRT-PCR, colony formation, 
and wound healing assays were applied to gain mechanistic insights and to 
understand the behavior of colorectal cancer cells upon the treatment of 
compound 8g. Also, a molecular docking analysis was conducted to provide in 
silico insights into the reported hCA IX inhibitory activity and selectivity.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115538

a traditional herbal formulas used for the treatment of respiratory tract 
infections. They were initially prescribed to treat skin disease, such as 
psoriasis in Chinese Taiwan, but are not widely used for psoriasis treatment in 
mainland China because of the lack of anti-psoriasis mechanism research.
PURPOSES: The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-psoriasis effect 
of JFG and reveal the correlated mechanisms of JFG in vivo and in vitro using 
network pharmacology, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technology and molecular biotechnology 
methods.
RESULTS: An imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like murine model was used to verify the 
anti-psoriasis effect in vivo, with inhibition of lymphocytosis and CD3+CD19+B 
cell proliferation in the peripheral blood and prevention of the activation of 
CD4+IL17+T cells and CD11c+ MHC Ⅱ+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the spleen. Network 
pharmacology analysis demonstrated that the targets of the active components 
were significantly enriched in pathways involved in cancer, inflammatory bowel 
disease and rheumatoid arthritis, which were closely related to cell 
proliferation and immune regulation. The drug-component-target networks and 
molecular docking analysis demonstrated the active ingredients to be luteolin, 
naringin and 6'-feruloylnodakenin, which had a good binding affinity to PPARγ, 
p38a MAPK and TNF-a. Finally, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis to validate the active 
ingredients in drug-containing serum and in vitro experiments showed that JFG 
inhibited the maturation and activation of BMDCs via the p38a MAPK signaling 
pathway and translocation of the agonist PPARγ into the nuclei to reduce the 
activity of NF-κB/STAT3 inflammatory signaling pathway in keratinocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that JFG improved psoriasis by inhibiting 
the maturation and activation of BMDCs and proliferation and inflammation of 
keratinocytes, which may facilitate the applications of JFG in anti-psoriasis 
therapy in clinical settings.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier GmbH.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154925

whose clinical application is substantially constrained by its cardiotoxicity. 
The pathophysiology of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity manifests as cardiomyocyte 
pyroptosis and inflammation. Amentoflavone (AMF) is a naturally occurring 
biflavone possessing anti-pyroptotic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, 
the mechanism through which AMF alleviates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains 
undetermined.
PURPOSE: This study aimed at investigating the role of AMF in alleviating 
DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To assess the in vivo effect of AMF, DOX was 
intraperitoneally administered into a mouse model to induce cardiotoxicity. To 
elucidate the underlying mechanisms, the activities of STING/NLRP3 were 
quantified using the NLRP3 agonist nigericin and the STING agonist 
amidobenzimidazole (ABZI). Primary cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal 
Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with saline (vehicle) or DOX with or without 
AMF and/or ABZI. The echocardiogram, haemodynamics, cardiac injury markers, 
heart/body weight ratio, and pathological alterations were monitored; the 
STING/NLRP3 pathway-associated proteins were detected by western blot and 
cardiomyocyte pyroptosis was analysed by immunofluorescence staining of cleaved 
N-terminal GSDMD and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, we evaluated the 
potential of AMF in compromising the anticancer effects of DOX in human breast 
cancer cell lines.
RESULTS: AMF substantially alleviated cardiac dysfunction and reduced heart/body 
weight ratio and myocardial damage in mice models of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. 
AMF effectively suppressed DOX-mediated upregulation of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and 
pyroptosis-related proteins, including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and cleaved 
N-terminal GSDMD. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins, namely Bax, cleaved 
caspase-3, and BCL-2 were not affected. In addition, AMF inhibited STING 
phosphorylation in DOX-affected hearts. Intriguingly, the administration of 
nigericin or ABZI dampened the cardioprotective effects of AMF. The in vitro 
anti-pyroptotic effect of AMF was demonstrated in attenuating the DOX-induced 
reduction in cardiomyocyte cell viability, upregulation of cleaved N-terminal 
GSDMD, and pyroptotic morphology alteration at the microstructural level. AMF 
exhibited a synergistic effect with DOX to reduce the viability of human breast 
cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: AMF alleviates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing 
cardiomyocyte pyroptosis and inflammation via inhibition of the STING/NLRP3 
signalling pathway, thereby validating its efficacy as a cardioprotective agent.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154922

of breast cancer by inducing angiogenesis. Several therapeutic strategies have 
been designed for the treatment of breast cancer by specifically preventing 
angiogenesis. But there is a dearth of study regarding the treatment procedure 
which can specifically target and kill the BCSCs and cause lesser harm to 
healthy cells of the body. A plant-based bioactive compound Quinacrine (QC) 
specifically kills cancer stem cells (CSCs) without harming healthy cells and 
also inhibits cancer angiogenesis but the detailed mechanistic study of its 
anti-CSCs and anti-angiogenic activity is yet to explore.
HYPOTHESIS: Earlier report showed that both cMET and ABCG2 play an essential 
role in cancer angiogenesis. Both are present on the cell surface of CSCs and 
share an identical ATP-binding domain. Interestingly, QC a plant based and 
bioactive compound which was found to inhibit the function of CSCs marker cMET 
and ABCG2. These relevant evidence led us to hypothesize that cMET and ABCG2 may 
interact with each other and induce the production of angiogenic factors, 
resulting in activation of cancer angiogenesis and QC might disrupt the 
interaction between them to stop this phenomena.
METHODS: Co-immunoprecipitation assay, immunofluorescence assay, and western 
blotting were performed by using ex vivo patient-derived breast 
cancer-stem-cells (PDBCSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). 
In silico study was carried out to check the interaction between cMET and ABCG2 
in presence or absence of QC. Tube formation assay using HUVECs and in ovo 
Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay using chick fertilized eggs were performed 
to monitor angiogenesis. In vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice model was 
used to validate in silico and ex vivo results.
RESULTS: Data revealed that in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME), cMET and 
ABCG2 interact with each other and upregulate HIF-1α/VEGF-A axis to induce 
breast cancer angiogenesis. In silico and ex vivo study showed that QC disrupted 
the interaction between cMET and ABCG2 to inhibit the angiogenic response in 
endothelial cells by reducing the secretion of VEGF-A from PDBCSCs within the 
TME. Knockdown of cMET, ABCG2 or both, significantly downregulated the 
expression of HIF-1α and reduced the secretion of pro-angiogenic factor VEGF-A 
in the TME of PDBCSCs. Additionally, when PDBCSCs were treated with QC, similar 
experimental results were obtained.
CONCLUSION: In silico, in ovo, ex vivo and in vivo data confirmed that QC 
inhibited the HIF-1α/VEGF-A mediated angiogenesis in breast cancer by disrupting 
the interaction between cMET and ABCG2.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154914

cancer (NSCLC) patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). The rationale for 
immunotherapy and its adverse events for NSCLC with ILD remains unclear. In this 
study, we examined T cell profiles and functions in the lung tissues of NSCLC 
patients with or without ILD to provide evidence for the potential mechanism of 
immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis in NSCLC patients with 
ILD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated T cell immunity in the lung tissues of 
NSCLC patients with ILD to support the application of immunotherapy for these 
patients. We analyzed T cell profiles and functions in surgically resected lung 
tissues from NSCLC patients with and without ILD. The T cell profiles of 
infiltrating cells in lung tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry. T cell 
functions were measured based on cytokine production by T cells stimulated with 
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin.
RESULTS: The percentages of CD4+ T cells expressing immune checkpoint molecules 
(Tim-3, ICOS, and 4-1BB), CD103+CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells were 
higher in NSCLC patients with than in those without ILD. A functional analysis 
of T cells in lung tissues indicated that CD103+CD8+ T cells positively 
correlated with IFNγ production, whereas Treg cells negatively correlated with 
IFNγ and TNFα production. Cytokine production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not 
significantly differ between NSCLC patients with and without ILD, except for 
TNFα production by CD4+ T cells being lower in the former than in the latter.
CONCLUSION: In NSCLC patients with ILD stable for surgery, T cells were active 
participants and balanced in part by Treg cells in lung tissues, suggesting the 
potential development of ICI-related pneumonitis in NSCLC patients with ILD.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2023.107278

for inoperable early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Use of image 
guided thermal ablation (IGTA; including microwave ablation [MWA] and 
radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) has increased in NSCLC, however there are no 
studies comparing all three.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of IGTA (including MWA and RFA) and SBRT for 
the treatment of NSCLC.
METHODS: Published literature databases were systematically searched for studies 
assessing MWA, RFA, or SBRT. Local tumor progression (LTP), disease-free 
survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed with single-arm pooled 
analyses and meta-regressions in NSCLC patients and a stage IA subgroup. Study 
quality was assessed with a modified methodological index for non-randomized 
studies (MINORS) tool.
RESULTS: Forty IGTA study-arms (2,691 patients) and 215 SBRT study-arms (54,789 
patients) were identified. LTP was lowest after SBRT at one and two years in 
single-arm pooled analyses (4% and 9% vs. 11% and 18%) and at one year in 
meta-regressions when compared to IGTA (OR = 0.2, 95%CI = 0.07-0.63). MWA 
patients had the highest DFS of all treatments in single-arm pooled analyses. In 
meta-regressions at two and three-years, DFS was significantly lower for RFA 
compared to MWA (OR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.12-0.58; OR = 0.33, 95%CI = 0.16-0.66, 
respectively). OS was similar across modalities, timepoints, and analyses. Older 
age, male patients, larger tumors, retrospective studies, and non-Asian study 
region were also predictors of worse clinical outcomes. In high-quality studies 
(MINORS score ≥ 7), MWA patients had better clinical outcomes than the overall 
analysis. Stage IA MWA patients had lower LTP, higher OS, and generally lower 
DFS, compared to the main analysis of all NSCLC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC patients had comparable outcomes after SBRT and MWA, which 
were better than those with RFA.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2023.107259

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) is causally associated with an increased 
incidence of lung cancers. In both occupational atmospheres and ambient air, 
PAHs are present as a mixture of many compounds, but the composition of the 
mixture in ambient air differs from that in the occupational atmosphere, and 
varies in time and space in ambient air. Estimates of cancer risk for PAH 
mixtures are based upon unit risks which derive from extrapolation of 
occupational exposure data or animal model data, and in the case of the WHO use 
one compound, benzo[a]pyrene as a marker for the entire mixture, irrespective of 
composition. The U.S. EPA has used an animal exposure study to derive a unit 
risk for inhalation exposure to benzo[a]pyrene alone, and there have been a 
number of rankings of relative carcinogenic potency for other PAHs which many 
studies have used to calculate a cancer risk from the PAHs mixture, frequently 
incorrectly by adding the estimated relative risks of individual compounds, and 
applying the total ""B[a]P equivalent"" to the WHO unit risk, which already 
applies to the entire mixture. Such studies are often based upon data solely for 
the historic US EPA group of 16 compounds which do not include many of the 
apparently more potent carcinogens. There are no data for human cancer risk of 
individual PAHs, and conflicting evidence of additivity of PAH carcinogenicity 
in mixtures. This paper finds large divergences between risk estimates deriving 
from the WHO and U.S. EPA methods, as well as considerable sensitivity to the 
mixture composition, and assumed PAH relative potencies. Of the two methods, the 
WHO approach appears more likely to provide reliable risk estimates, but 
recently proposed mixture-based approaches using in vitro toxicity data may 
offer some advantages.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.envint.2023.107991

but its association with non-cardiovascular diseases, especially cancer, is 
controversial. Serum lipoprotein (a) levels vary widely by genetic backgrounds 
and are largely determined by the genetic variations of apolipoprotein (a) gene, 
LPA. In this study, we investigate the association between SNPs in LPA region 
and cancer incidence and mortality in Japanese.
METHODS: A genetic cohort study was conducted utilizing the data from 9923 
participants in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (JPHC 
Study). Twenty-five SNPs in the LPAL2-LPA region were selected from the 
genome-wide genotyped data. Cox regression analysis adjusted for the covariates 
and competing risks of death from other causes, were used to estimate the 
relative risk (hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) of overall 
and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality, for each SNP.
RESULTS: No significant association was found between SNPs in the LPAL2-LPA 
region and cancer incidence or mortality (overall/site-specific cancer). In men, 
however, HRs for stomach cancer incidence of 18SNPs were estimated higher than 
1.5 (e.g., 2.15 for rs13202636, model free, 95%CI: 1.28-3.62) and those for 
stomach cancer mortality of 2SNPs (rs9365171, rs1367211) were estimated 2.13 
(recessive, 95%CI:1.04-4.37) and 1.61 (additive, 95%CI: 1.00-2.59). 
Additionally, the minor allele for SNP rs3798220 showed increased death risk 
from colorectal cancer (CRC) in men (HR: 3.29, 95% CI:1.59 - 6.81) and decreased 
CRC incidence risk in women (HR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.22-0.94). Minor allele carrier 
of any of 4SNPs could have risk of prostate cancer incidence (e.g., rs9365171 
dominant, HR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.06-2.77).
CONCLUSIONS: None of the 25 SNPs in the LPAL2-LPA region was found to be 
significantly associated with cancer incidence or mortality. Considering the 
possible association between SNPs in LPAL2-LPA region and colorectal, prostate 
and stomach cancer incidence or mortality, further analysis using different 
cohorts is warranted.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.canep.2023.102395

for pancreas cancer (PDAC) has been demonstrated to improve survival. However, 
the optimal adjuvant treatment (AT) regimen for R1-margin patients remains 
unclear. This retrospective study investigates the impact of AC vs. adjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy (ACRT) on survival (OS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The NCDB was queried for patients with PDAC who underwent 
PD between 2010 and 2018. Patients were divided into, (A) AC<60 days, (B) 
ACRT<60 days, (C) AC≥60 days, and (D) ACRT≥60 days. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analyses and Cox multivariable regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among 13 740 patients, median OS was 23.7 months. For R1 patients, 
median OS for timely AC and ACRT, and delayed AC and ACRT was 19.91, 19.19, 
15.24, 18.96 months, respectively. While time of AC initiation was an 
insignificant factor for R0 patients (p = 0.263, CI 0.957-1.173), a survival 
benefit was found for R1 patients who received AC<60 vs. ≥60 days (p = 0.041, CI 
1.002-1.42). Among R1 patients, administration of delayed ACRT achieves the same 
survival benefit of timely AC initiation (p = 0.074, CI 0.703-1.077).
CONCLUSION: The study suggests value in ACRT for patients with R1 margins when 
delay of AT≥60 days cannot be avoided. Hence, ACRT may mitigate the negative 
impact of delayed AT initiation for R1-patients.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.suronc.2023.101961

NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) show a promising anticancer effect in 
clinical trials. We previously identified a natural NQO1 substrate 
2-methoxy-6-acetyl-7-methyljuglone (MAM) with a potent anticancer effect. The 
present study was designed to explore the efficacy of MAM in fighting against 
drug-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The anticancer effect of MAM 
was evaluated in cisplatin-resistant A549 and AZD9291-resistant H1975 cells. The 
interaction of MAM with NQO1 was measured by cellular thermal shift assay and 
drug affinity responsive target stability assay. The NQO1 activity and 
expression were measured using NQO1 recombinant protein, Western blotting, and 
immunofluorescence staining assay. The roles of NQO1 were examined by NQO1 
inhibitor, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA). The 
roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS), labile iron pool (LIP), and lipid 
peroxidation were determined. MAM induced significant cell death in 
drug-resistant cells with similar potency to that of parental cells, which were 
completely abolished by NQO1 inhibitor, NQO1 siRNA, and iron chelators. MAM 
activates and binds to NQO1, which triggers ROS generation, LIP increase, and 
lipid peroxidation. MAM significantly suppressed tumor growth in the tumor 
xenograft zebrafish model. These results showed that MAM induced ferroptosis by 
targeting NQO1 in drug-resistant NSCLC cells. Our findings provided a novel 
therapeutic strategy for fighting against drug resistance by induction of 
NQO1-mediated ferroptosis.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.drup.2023.100977

(DOX) drug is investigated for the first time by using density functional theory 
(DFT). Doxorubicin drug is effective in the cure of numerous types of cancer 
including bone cancer, gastric, thyroid, bladder, ovarian, breast, and soft 
tissue cancer. Doxorubicin drug prevents the cell division process by 
intercalating in the double-helix of DNA and stopping its replication. The 
optimized, geometrical, energetic, and excited-state characteristics of graphyne 
(GYN), doxorubicin drug (DOX), and doxorubicin-graphyne complex (DOX@GYN 
complex) are calculated to see how effective it is as a carrier. The DOX drug 
interacted with GYN with an adsorption-energy of -1.57 eV (gas-phase). The 
interaction of GYN with DOX drug is investigated using NCI (non-covalent 
interaction) analysis. The findings of this analysis showed that the DOX@GYN 
complex has weak forces of interaction. Charge transfer from doxorubicin drug to 
GYN during DOX@GYN complex formation is described by charge-decomposition 
analysis and HOMO-LUMO analysis. The increased dipole-moment (8.41 D) of the 
DOX@GYN in contrast with therapeutic agent DOX and GYN indicated that the drug 
will move easily in the biochemical system. Furthermore, the photo-induced 
electron-transfer process is explored for excited states, and it reveals that 
upon interaction, fluorescence-quenching will occur in the complex DOX@GYN. In 
addition, the influence of the positive and negative charge states on the GYN 
and DOX@GYN is also considered. Overall, the findings indicated that the GYN 
could be exploited as an effective drug-transporter for the delivery of 
doxorubicin drug. Investigators will be inspired to look at another 2D 
nanomaterials for drug transport applications as a result of this theoretical 
work.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jmgm.2023.108537

of cancer is inflammatory condition. Although acute inflammation is essential 
for the wound healing and reconstruction of tissues that have been damaged, 
chronic inflammation may contribute to the onset and growth of a number of 
diseases, including cancer. By disrupting the signaling processes of cells, 
which result in cancer induction, invasion, and development, a variety of 
inflammatory molecules are linked to the development of cancer. The 
microenvironment surrounding the tumor is greatly influenced by inflammatory 
cells and their subsequent secretions, which also contribute significantly to 
the tumor's growth, survivability, and potential migration. These inflammatory 
variables have been mentioned in several publications as prospective diagnostic 
tools for anticipating the onset of cancer. Targeting inflammation with various 
therapies can reduce the inflammatory response and potentially limit or block 
the proliferation of cancer cells. The scientific medical literature from the 
past three decades has been studied to determine how inflammatory chemicals and 
cell signaling pathways related to cancer invasion and metastasis are related. 
The current narrative review updates the relevant literature while highlighting 
the specifics of inflammatory signaling pathways in cancer and their possible 
therapeutic possibilities.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights

cancers of diverse etiologies. In prostate cancer (PCa) cells, LCN2 regulates 
distinct phenotypic features, including cytoskeleton organization and expression 
of inflammation mediators. Oncolytic virotherapy uses oncolytic viruses (OVs) to 
kill cancer cells and induce anti-tumor immunity. A main source of specificity 
of OVs towards tumor cells stems from cancer-induced defects in interferon 
(IFN)-based cell autonomous immune responses. However, the molecular 
underpinnings of such defects in PCa cells are only partially understood. 
Moreover, LCN2 effects on IFN responses of PCa cells and their susceptibility to 
OVs are unknown. To examine these issues, we queried gene expression databases 
for genes coexpressed with LCN2, revealing co-expression of IFN-stimulated genes 
(ISGs) and LCN2. Analysis of human PCa cells revealed correlated expression of 
LCN2 and subsets of IFNs and ISGs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated stable knockout of LCN2 
in PC3 cells or transient overexpression of LCN2 in LNCaP cells revealed 
LCN2-mediated regulation of IFNE (and IFNL1) expression, activation of JAK/STAT 
pathway, and expression of selected ISGs. Accordingly, and dependent on a 
functional JAK/STAT pathway, LCN2 reduced the susceptibility of PCa cells to 
infection with the IFN-sensitive OV, EHDV-TAU. In PC3 cells, LCN2 knockout 
increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α). 
Inhibition of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in PC3-LCN2-KO cells reduced p-eIF2α 
while increasing constitutive IFNE expression, phosphorylation of STAT1, and ISG 
expression; and decreasing EHDV-TAU infection. Together, these data propose that 
LCN2 regulates PCa susceptibility to OVs through attenuation of PERK activity 
and increased IFN and ISG expression.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2023.151328

agents alter the activity of functional proteins, identifying functional target 
proteins of small bioactive molecules isessential for the rational design of 
stronger medicines. Flavonoids with antioxidant, anti-allergy, and 
anti-inflammatory effects are expected to have preventive effects for several 
diseases closely related to oxidation and inflammation, including heart disease, 
cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and eye diseases. Therefore, identifying 
the proteins involved in the pharmacological actions of flavonoids, and 
designing a flavonoid structure-based medicine that strongly and specifically 
inhibits flavonoid target proteins, could aid the development of more effective 
medicines for treating heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and 
ocular diseases with few side effects. To isolate the flavonoid target protein, 
we conducted a novel affinity chromatography in a column wherein baicalin, a 
representative flavonoid, was attached to Affi-Gel 102. Through affinity 
chromatography and nano LC-MS/MS, we identified GAPDH as a flavonoid target 
protein. Then, we performed fluorescence quenching and an enzyme inhibition 
assay to experimentally confirmbaicalin's binding affinity for, and inhibition 
of, GAPDH. We also conducted in silico docking simulations to visualize the 
binding modes of baicalin and the newly identified flavonoid target protein, 
GAPDH. From the results of this study, it was considered that one of the reasons 
why baicalin exhibits the effects on cancer and neurodegenerative diseases is 
that it inhibits the activity of GAPDH. In summary, we showed that Affi-Gel102 
could quickly and accurately isolate the target protein for bioactive small 
molecules, without the need for isotopic labeling or a fluorescent probe. By 
using the method presented here, it was possible to easily isolate the target 
protein of a medicine containing a carboxylic acid.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2023.117362

microsurgery. If vein anastomosis is performed before the artery, heparin 
irrigation into the artery can be performed locally without systematic effect. 
This study aimed to introduce this ""intraflap perfusion procedure"" in autologous 
breast reconstruction.
METHODS: Among the 220 patients with unilateral breast cancer who had received 
the free abdominal flap, we retrospectively compared those that had undergone 
the intraflap perfusion procedure (n = 108) and those who did not (n = 112). A 
10 mL injection of heparinized physiological saline solution (100 units/mL) was 
administered into the deep inferior epigastric artery. Intraflap perfusion was 
performed before, during, and after vein anastomosis, without the vessel clip of 
the vein. Artery anastomosis was performed without the use of a vein clamp. 
Further, vein anastomosis was performed tightly to prevent leakage from the vein 
anastomosis site during artery anastomosis.
RESULTS: The rates of superficial inferior epigastric vein (SIEV) superdrainage 
(18.5% vs. 42.0%, P < 0.001), and intraoperative flap congestion (0.9% vs. 8.0%, 
P = 0.01) were significantly lower in patients undergoing this procedure. There 
were no significant differences regarding other factors (age, BMI, laterality, 
comorbidities, and other operative details).
CONCLUSIONS: Intraflap perfusion prevented long-term stasis at the venous 
anastomosis site and capillary level. It could reduce flap congestion. SIEV 
superdrainage was performed to manage flap congestion, particularly in patients 
who did not undergo this procedure. Consequently, it can be inferred that this 
procedure reduces the rate of superdrainage.","Copyright © 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic

incidence increases with age. As a consequence, an increasing number of frail 
patients are being referred for consideration of skin cancer surgery. However, 
some of these patients may not live long enough to experience benefit from 
surgery, while being at risk of postoperative complications.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the treatment burden of surgical excision of skin 
cancers in frail individuals.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study analyzing 
outcomes of skin cancer excision in frail versus non-frail patients.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were included. The complication rate was higher 
in frail versus non-frail patients: 12 (27.9%) versus 9 (18.8%), with 5 
unplanned postoperative hospital attendances leading to 3 hospital admissions in 
the frail cohort. Nine patients in the frail group (21%) died within 6 months of 
their procedure versus no deaths in the non-frail group (p < 0.001 Fisher's 
Exact test), with no deaths attributed to skin cancer.
CONCLUSION: Treatment-related complications and mortality are common in frail 
patients after surgical excision of skin lesions clinically suspicious for skin 
cancer. Careful consideration should be given, and patients should be adequately 
counseled about treatment risks and alternative management options, including 
active surveillance, in particular, if the lesions are expected to remain 
asymptomatic.","Copyright © 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic

learning, has drawn a growing amount of attention from computer vision 
researchers in recent years. This method has drawn a lot of interest because of 
its extraordinary ability to interpret medical pictures, especially when 
combined with residual neural networks, which have helped to progress the field.
METHODS: In this paper, the following research is carried out on the residual 
network. First, the research status of ResNet in the medical field is 
introduced. The fundamental idea behind the residual neural network is then 
explained, along with the residual unit, its many structures, and the network 
architecture. Second, four aspects of the widespread use of residual neural 
networks in medical image processing are discussed: lung tumor, diagnosis of 
skin diseases, diagnosis of breast diseases, and diagnosis of diseases of the 
brain. Finally, the main issues and ResNet's future development in the area of 
processing medical images are discussed.
RESULTS: In the area of medical graph processing, residual neural networks have 
made strides and have had success in the clinical auxiliary diagnosis of serious 
illnesses such as lung tumors, breast cancer, skin conditions, and 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
CONCLUSION: We thoroughly sorted out the most recent developments in residual 
neural network research and their use in medical image processing, which serves 
as a crucial point of reference for this field of study. It offers a helpful 
reference for further promoting the application and research of the ResNet model 
in the field of medical image processing by summarising the application status 
and issues of the ResNet model in the field of medical image processing and

therapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients is linked to the mutual 
domestication between the tumour and its surrounding microenvironment.
AIM: Our study aims to explore the remodelling of tumour microenvironment after 
osimertinib treatment resistance.
METHODS: We took RNA-seq-based tumour immune infiltration analysis using the 
TIMER 2.0. We carried out flow cytometry assay and real-time cell analysis to 
explore the interaction between tumour cells and immune cells. In addition, we 
analysed exosomes via miRNA-seq and label-free proteomics.
RESULTS: Immune infiltration estimation showed a significant decrease in the 
immune score (P < 0.001), microenvironment score (P < 0.001) and CD8+ T cells 
(P < 0.05), but an increase in M0 macrophages (P < 0.01) at osimertinib 
resistance compared to pre-treatment patients. It was demonstrated that exosomes 
from H1975OR cells could be taken up by macrophages and drove their polarisation 
towards the M2 phenotype, and the polarised M2 macrophages could reduce the 
inhibitory effect on tumour cell proliferation. Pre-activated peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells exhibited a more potent killing effect on H1975OR cells. We 
also detected a decrease in CD4+HLA-DR- T cells and an increase in CD4+PD1+ T 
cells after being co-cultured with H1975OR derived exosomes or conditioned 
medium. Further miRNA-seq and proteomics analysis of exosomes demonstrated that 
mir-1258-3p and miR-17-5p might participate in this interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: An immunosuppressive environment, characterised by decreased T cell 
infiltration and activation, whereas increased macrophage infiltration and M2 
polarisation, was identified at osimertinib resistance. This interaction may be 
carried out by tumour-derived exosomes.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2023.05.007

overall survival (OS) among older patients with cancer. However, geriatric 
syndromes, known to be associated with OS in the geriatric population, were 
rarely studied. Thus, our aim was to identify the determinants of OS among 
French older adults with cancer, including geriatric syndromes before cancer 
diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using cancer registries, we identified older subjects 
(≥65 years) with cancer in three French prospective cohort studies on aging from 
the Gironde department. Survival time was calculated from the date of diagnosis 
to the date of all-cause death or to the date of last follow-up, whichever came 
first. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, smoking status, self-rated 
health, cancer-related factors (stage at diagnosis, treatment), as well as 
geriatric syndromes (polypharmacy, activity limitation, depressive 
symptomatology, and cognitive impairment or dementia) were studied. Analyses 
were performed using Cox proportional hazard models for the whole population, 
then by age group (65-84 and 85+).
RESULTS: Among the 607 subjects included in the study, the median age at cancer 
diagnosis was 84 years. Smoking habits, activity limitations, cognitive 
impairment or dementia, advanced cancer stage and absence of treatment were 
significantly associated with lower OS in the analysis including the whole 
population. Women presented higher OS. Factors associated with OS differed by 
age group. Polypharmacy was inversely associated with OS in older adults aged 
65-84 and 85 + .
DISCUSSION: Our findings support that geriatric assessment is needed to identify 
patients at higher risk of death and that an evaluation of activity limitation 
in older adults is essential. Improving early detection could enable 
interventions to address factors (activity limitations, cognitive impairment) 
associated with OS, potentially reducing disparities and lead to earlier 
palliative care.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101539

patient care experiences (PCEs) differ between males with prostate cancer (""PCa 
group"") and males without cancer (""non-cancer group"").
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study used 2007-2015 National Cancer 
Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry data linked to 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys. PCa and 
non-cancer groups were propensity score matched 1:5 on demographic and clinical 
characteristics. Differences in racial/ethnic disparities (DRD) (non-Hispanic 
Black [NHB], Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian [NHA], and Other Races compared to 
non-Hispanic White [NHW]) in PCEs (getting needed care, getting care quickly, 
doctor communication, customer service, and getting needed prescription drugs) 
were compared between matched PCa and non-cancer groups. Per prior literature, 
DRD in PCE scores were categorized as small (<3), medium (≥3 but <5) or large 
(≥5).
RESULTS: There were 7312 males in the PCa group and 36,559 matched males in the 
non-cancer group. Within each group, all racial/ethnic minority categories 
reported worse scores compared to NHW individuals (p < 0.05) for ≥3 PCE 
composite measures. Compared to PCa group, a larger NHA-NHW difference was 
observed in non-cancer group for getting needed care (-4.65 in PCa vs. -7.77 in 
non-cancer; DRD = 3.11, p = 0.029) and doctor communication (-2.46 in PCa vs. 
-4.85 in non-cancer; DRD = 2.38, p = 0.023).
DISCUSSION: In both PCa and non-cancer groups, racial/ethnic minorities reported 
worse experiences compared to NHW individuals for several PCE measures. However, 
the difference in getting needed care and doctor communication between NHA and 
NHW individuals were more pronounced in non-cancer group than PCa group.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101554

implementing geriatric assessment (GA) in oncology practice, we undertook a 
synthetic, model-based economic evaluation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model with embedded Markov chains was 
developed to simulate a cost-effectiveness analysis of implementing GA within 
standard oncological care compared to current practice. This was for patients 
aged 77 years (the mean age in included trials) receiving chemotherapy or 
surgery as first-line treatment. Assumptions were made about model parameters, 
based on available literature, to calculate the incremental net health benefit 
(INHB) of GA, using a data synthesis.
RESULTS: GA has additional costs over standard care alone of between £390 and 
£576, depending upon implementation configuration. When major assumptions about 
the effectiveness of GA were modelled, INHB was marginally positive (0.09-0.12) 
at all cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs). If no reduction in postoperative 
complications was assumed, the intervention was shown not to be cost-effective 
(INHB negative at all CETs). When used before chemotherapy, with minimal 
healthcare staffing inputs and technological assistance, GA is cost-effective 
(INHB positive between 0.06 and 0.07 at all CETs).
DISCUSSION: Considering emerging evidence that GA improves outcomes in oncology, 
GA may not be a cost-effective intervention when used for all older adults with 
cancer. However, with judicious selection of implementation models, GA has the 
potential to be cost-effective. Due to significant heterogeneity and centre 
dependent success in implementation and effectiveness, GA is difficult to study 
in oncology settings. Stakeholders could take a pragmatic approach towards GA 
introduction with local evaluation favoured over generalisable research. Because 
GA tends towards utilitarianism and has no safety issues, it is a suitable 
intervention for more widespread implementation.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101504

induce tumor cell apoptosis is a significant tumor therapeutic strategy. 
Piperine, a natural product from black pepper, has been demonstrated to suppress 
tumor cell proliferation by enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
subsequently leading to cell death. However, the development of Piperine as an 
active molecule is hampered by its weak cytotoxicity. To develop a compound with 
higher activity, we synthesized 22 Piperine analogs and evaluated their 
pharmacological properties. Ultimately, B5 was screened by the results of 
cytotoxicity and inhibition of TrxR activity. In contrast to Piperine, B5 had 
significant cytotoxicity with a 4-fold increase. The structure-activity 
relationship demonstrated that the introduction of an electron-withdrawing group 
into the benzene ring adjacent to the amino group, particularly in the 
meta-position, was positive and that shortening the olefin double bond had no 
appreciable impact on cytotoxicity. Further investigating the physiological 
activity of B5 in HeLa cells, we found that B5 selectively inhibits the activity 
of TrxR by binding to Sec residues on TrxR. B5 then induces cellular oxidative 
stress and finally leads to apoptosis. As a result, the study of B5 paved the 
way for further investigation into the modification and function of Piperine

toward image quality assessment in multi-parametric prostate MRI (mpMRI). 
Previous studies have demonstrated moderate to excellent inter-rater agreement 
among expert readers; however, there is a need for studies to assess the 
inter-reader agreement of PI-QUAL scoring in basic prostate readers.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the inter-reader agreement of the PI-QUAL score amongst 
basic prostate readers on multi-center prostate mpMRI.
METHODS: Five basic prostate readers from different centers assessed the PI-QUAL 
scores independently using T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) 
including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and 
dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) images on mpMRI data obtained from five 
different centers following Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 
2.1. The inter-reader agreements amongst radiologists for PI-QUAL were evaluated 
using weighted Cohen's kappa. Further, the absolute agreements in assessing the 
diagnostic adequacy of each mpMRI sequence were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 355 men with a median age of 71 years (IQR, 60-78) were 
enrolled in the study. The pair-wise kappa scores ranged from 0.656 to 0.786 for 
the PI-QUAL scores, indicating good inter-reader agreements between the readers. 
The pair-wise absolute agreements ranged from 0.75 to 0.88 for T2W imaging, from 
0.74 to 0.83 for the ADC maps, and from 0.77 to 0.86 for DCE images.
CONCLUSIONS: Basic prostate radiologists from different institutions provided 
good inter-reader agreements on multi-center data for the PI-QUAL scores.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2023.110923

diffusion coefficient (ADC) with the Kaiser score (KS) for diagnosing BI-RADS 4 
lesions.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 194 consecutive patients with 201 
histologically verified BI-RADS 4 lesions. Two radiologists assigned the KS 
value to each lesion. Adding microcalcifications, ADC, or both these criteria to 
the KS yielded KS1, KS2, and KS3, respectively. The potential of all four scores 
to avoid unnecessary biopsies was assessed using the sensitivity and 
specificity. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by the area under the curve 
(AUC) and compared between KS and KS1.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of KS, KS1, KS2, and KS3 ranged from 77.1% to 
100.0%.KS1 yielded significantly higher sensitivity than other methods 
(P < 0.05), except for KS3 (P > 0.05), most of all, when assessing NME lesions. 
For mass lesions, the sensitivity of these four scores was comparable 
(p > 0.05). The specificity of KS, KS1, KS2, and KS3 ranged from 56.0% to 69.4%, 
with no statistically significant differences(P > 0.05), except between KS1 and 
KS2 (p < 0.05).The AUC of KS1 (0.877) was significantly higher than that of KS 
(0.837; P = 0.0005), particularly for assessing NME (0.847 vs 0.713; 
P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: KS can stratify BI-RADS 4 lesions to avoid unnecessary biopsies. 
Adding microcalcifications, but not adding ADC, as an adjunct to KS improves 
diagnostic performance, particularly for NME lesions. ADC provides no additional 
diagnostic benefit to KS. Thus, only combining microcalcifications with KS is 
most conducive to clinical practice.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2023.110920

established imaging biomarkers to show angiogenesis in tumor tissue. The aim of 
this prospective study was to evaluate whether semiquantitative and 
pharmacokinetic DCE-MRI perfusion parameters could be used to assess 
angiogenesis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
METHOD: We enrolled 38 patients with primary EOC treated in 2011-2014. DCE-MRI 
was performed with a 3.0 T imaging system before the surgical treatment. Two 
different sizes of ROI were used to evaluate semiquantitative and 
pharmacokinetic DCE perfusion parameters: a large ROI (L-ROI) covering the whole 
primary lesion on one plane and a small ROI (S-ROI) covering a small solid, 
highly enhancing focus. Tissue samples from tumors were collected during the 
surgery. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expression of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptors (VEGFRs) and to analyse 
microvascular density (MVD) and the number of microvessels.
RESULTS: VEGF expression correlated inversely with Ktrans (L-ROI, r = -0.395 
(p = 0.009), S-ROI, r = -0.390, (p = 0.010)), Ve (L-ROI, r = -0.395 (p = 0.009), 
S-ROI, r = -0.412 (p = 0.006)) and Vp (L-ROI, r = -0.388 (p = 0.011), S-ROI, 
r = -0.339 (p = 0.028)) values in EOC. Higher VEGFR-2 correlated with lower DCE 
parameters Ktrans (L-ROI, r = -0.311 (p = 0.040), S-ROI, r = -0.337 (p = 0.025)) 
and Ve (L-ROI, r = -0.305 (p = 0.044), S-ROI, r = -0.355 (p = 0.018)). We also 
found that MVD and the number of microvessels correlated positively with AUC, 
Peak and WashIn values.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that several DCE-MRI parameters correlated with VEGF 
and VEGFR-2 expression and MVD. Thus, both semiquantitative and pharmacokinetic 
perfusion parameters of DCE-MRI represent promising tools for the assessment of 
angiogenesis in EOC.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2023.110925

malignant tumors dates back to the 1920s. Even with the minimal total dose 
administered during treatment, LDRT can result in long-lasting remission. 
Autocrine and paracrine signaling are widely recognized for fostering the growth 
and development of tumor cells. LDRT exerts systemic anti-tumor effects through 
various mechanisms, such as enhancing the activity of immune cells and 
cytokines, shifting the immune response towards an anti-tumor phenotype, 
influencing gene expression, and blocking crucial immunosuppressive pathways. 
Additionally, LDRT has been demonstrated to enhance the infiltration of 
activated T cells and initiate a series of inflammatory processes while 
modulating the tumor microenvironment. In this context, the objective of 
receiving radiation is not to directly kill tumor cells but to reprogram the 
immune system. Enhancing anti-tumor immunity may be a critical mechanism by 
which LDRT plays a role in cancer suppression. Therefore, this review primarily 
focuses on the clinical and preclinical efficacy of LDRT in combination with 
other anti-cancer strategies, such as the interaction between LDRT and the tumor 
microenvironment, and the remodeling of the immune system.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.tranon.2023.101710

determine various aspects of CAFs in HNSCC, including their cellular 
heterogeneity, prognostic value, relationship with immune suppression and 
immunotherapeutic response, intercellular communication, and metabolic activity. 
The prognostic significance of CKS2+ CAFs was verified using 
immunohistochemistry. Our findings revealed that fibroblasts group demonstrated 
prognostic significance, with the CKS2+ subset of inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) 
exhibiting a significant correlation with unfavorable prognosis and being 
localized in close proximity to cancer cells. Patients with a high infiltration 
of CKS2+ CAFs had a poor overall survival rate. There is a negative correlation 
between CKS2+ iCAFs and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, 
while a positive correlation was found with exhausted CD8+ T cells. 
Additionally, patients in Cluster 3, characterized by a high proportion of CKS2+ 
iCAFs, and patients in Cluster 2, characterized by a high proportion of CKS2- 
iCAFs and CENPF-/MYLPF- myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs), did not exhibit 
significant immunotherapeutic responses. Moreover, close interactions was 
confirmed to exist between cancer cells and CKS2+ iCAFs/ CENPF+ myCAFs. 
Furthermore, CKS2+ iCAFs demonstrated the highest level of metabolic activity. 
In summary, our study enhances the understanding of the heterogeneity of CAFs

decision-making for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a model for predicting treatment response to chemotherapy 
in NSCLC patients from pre-chemotherapy CT images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study enrolled 485 
patients with NSCLC who received chemotherapy alone as a first-line treatment. 
Two integrated models were developed using radiomic and deep-learning-based 
features. First, we partitioned pre-chemotherapy CT images into spheres and 
shells with different radii around the tumor (0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-15 mm) 
containing intratumoral and peritumoral regions. Second, we extracted radiomic 
and deep-learning-based features from each partition. Third, using radiomic 
features, five sphere-shell models, one feature fusion model, and one image 
fusion model were developed. Finally, the model with the best performance was 
validated in two cohorts.
RESULTS: Among the five partitions, the model of 9-12 mm achieved the highest 
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.94). The AUC 
was 0.94 (0.85-0.98) for the feature fusion model and 0.91 (0.82-0.97) for the 
image fusion model. For the model integrating radiomic and deep-learning-based 
features, the AUC was 0.96 (0.88-0.99) for the feature fusion method and 0.94 
(0.85-0.98) for the image fusion method. The best-performing model had an AUC of 
0.91 (0.81-0.97) and 0.89 (0.79-0.93) in two validation sets, respectively.

predictive biomarker of response to immunotherapy. We aimed to evaluate the 
impact of the usage of 3 different tissue processors in the IHC expression of 
PD-L1 antibody clones: 22C3 and SP142. Three different topographies of samples 
(n = 73) were selected at the macroscopy room: 39 uterine leiomyomas, 17 
placentas and 17 palatine tonsils. Three fragments were collected from each 
sample and were inked with a specific color that represented their separate 
processing in a different tissue processor (A, B or C). During embedding, the 3 
fragments with distinct processing were ensemble in the same cassette for 
sectioning of 3 slides/each: hematoxylin-eosin, 22C3 PDL1 IHC staining and SP142 
PD-L1 IHC staining, that were blindly observed by 2 pathologists under digital 
environment. All but one set of 3 fragments were considered adequate for 
observation even in the presence of artifacts associated with processing issues 
that were recorded as high as 50.7 % for processor C. The occurrence of 
background non-specific staining and the presence of false positive results 
appear to be unrelated with the PD-L1 clone or the type of tissue processing. 
22C3 PD-L1 was more frequently considered adequate for evaluation than SP142 
PD-L1 that, in 29.2 % of WSIs (after tissue processor C) were considered not 
adequate for observation due to lack of the typical pattern of expression. 
Similarly, the intensity of PD-L1 staining was significantly decreased in 
fragments processed by C (both PD-L1 clones) in tonsil and placenta specimens, 
and by A (both clones) in comparison with those processed by B. This study

external molecules with monitored and simplified systems. In this work, we have 
constructed artificial Langmuir single-lipid monolayers with 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine 
(DPPE), dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS), or sphingomyelin to resemble the 
main lipid components of the mammalian cell membranes. We determined the 
collapse pressure, minimum area per molecule, and maximum compression modulus 
(Cs-1) from surface pressure measurements in a Langmuir trough. Also, from 
compression/expansion isotherms, we estimated the viscoelastic properties of the 
monolayers. With this model, we explored the membrane molecular mechanism of 
toxicity of the well-known anticancer drug doxorubicin, with particular emphasis 
in cardiotoxicity. The results showed that doxorubicin intercalates mainly 
between DPPS and sphingomyelin, and less between DPPE, inducing a change in the 
Cs-1 of up to 34% for DPPS. The isotherm experiments suggested that doxorubicin 
had little effect on DPPC, partially solubilized DPPS lipids toward the bulk of 
the subphase, and caused a slight or large expansion in the DPPE and 
sphingomyelin monolayers, respectively. Furthermore, the dynamic viscoelasticity 
of the DPPE and DPPS membranes was greatly reduced (by 43 and 23%, 
respectively), while the reduction amounted only to 12% for sphingomyelin and 
DPPC models. In conclusion, doxorubicin intercalates into the DPPS, DPPE, and 
sphingomyelin, but not into the DPPC, membrane lipids, inducing a structural 
distortion that leads to decreased membrane stiffness and reduced 
compressibility modulus. These alterations may constitute a novel, early step in 
explaining the doxorubicin mechanism of action in mammalian cancer cells or its 
toxicity in non-cancer cells, with relevance to explain its cardiotoxicity.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00250

phase investigated long-term efficacy and safety of oral octreotide capsules 
(OOC) in patients with acromegaly. Core trial primary endpoint data demonstrated 
noninferiority to injectable somatostatin receptor ligands (iSRLs). Core trial 
completers were invited to participate in the OLE phase.
OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term efficacy and safety of OOC in patients with 
acromegaly who previously responded to and tolerated both OOC and injectable 
octreotide/lanreotide and completed the core phase. The unique study design of 
transitioning between OOC and iSRLs allowed within-patient evaluations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of biochemical responders (insulin-like growth 
factor I < 1.3 × upper limit of normal) at end of each extension year who 
entered that year as responders.
RESULTS: At year 1 extension end, 52/58 patients from both mono- and combination 
therapy groups were responders (89.7%; 95% CI, 78.8-96.1), 36/41 (87.8%; 95% CI, 
73.8-95.9) in year 2, and 29/31 (93.5%; 95% CI, 78.6-99.2) in year 3. No new or 
unexpected safety signals were detected; 1 patient withdrew owing to treatment 
failure. Patients who transitioned from iSRLs in the core trial to OOC in the 
OLE phase reported improved treatment convenience/satisfaction and symptom 
control.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported outcome data support for the first time that 
transitioning patients randomized to iSRL (who previously responded to both OOC 
and iSRLs) back to OOC, had significant effect on patients' symptoms score in a 
prospective cohort. The MPOWERED OLE showed long-term maintenance of response 
and sustained safety with OOC.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

safe and effective in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD) after 
unrelated-donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD HCT), leading to FDA 
approval. Here, we performed a detailed determination of abatacept 
pharmacokinetics (PK), which enabled an examination of how abatacept 
exposure-response (E-R) relationships impacted key clinical outcomes. To 
accomplish this, we performed a population PK analysis of intravenous abatacept 
using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, and assessed the association between 
abatacept exposure (dosed at 10 mg/kg on Days -1,+5,+14,+28) and key transplant 
outcomes. We tested the association between the trough concentration after dose 
1 (Ctrough_1) and Grade 2-4 acute GVHD (Gr 2-4 AGVHD) through Day+100 as the 
primary outcome in 184 HCT patients. An optimal Ctrough_1 threshold was 
identified by recursive partitioning and classification tree analysis. This 
demonstrated that abatacept PK was characterized by a two-compartment model with 
first-order elimination. The ABA2 dosing regimen was based on previous work 
targeting a steady-state abatacept trough of 10 μg/mL. However, a higher 
Ctrough_1 (≥39μg/mL, attained in ~60% of ABA2 patients) was associated with a 
favorable Gr 2-4 AGVHD risk (HR:0.35, 95%CI:0.19-0.65, p<0.001), with a 
Ctrough_1 <39μg/mL associated with Gr 2-4 AGVHD risk indistinguishable from 
placebo (p=0.37). Importantly, no significant association was found between 
Ctrough_1 and key safety indicators, including relapse, CMV viremia, and EBV 
viremia. These data demonstrate that, compared to a previously reported target 
Ctrough_1 of 10 μg/mL, a higher abatacept Ctrough_1 (≥39 μg/mL) was associated 
with a favorable Gr 2-4 AGVHD risk, without any observed exposure-toxicity 
relationships. Clinical trial NCT01743131.",Copyright © 2023 American Society of Hematology.,"DOI: 10.1182/blood.2023020035

acceptable safety in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), but longer-term response durability and outcome of 
patients who receive a second course after treatment discontinuation after 
complete response (CR) remain of clinical interest. We present KEYNOTE-087 data 
after >5 years of median follow-up. Patients with R/R cHL and progressive 
disease (PD) after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and brentuximab 
vedotin (BV; cohort 1); after salvage chemotherapy and BV without ASCT (cohort 
2); or after ASCT without subsequent BV (cohort 3) received pembrolizumab for ≤2 
years. Patients in CR who discontinued treatment and subsequently experienced PD 
were eligible for second-course pembrolizumab. Primary end points were objective 
response rate (ORR) by blinded central review and safety. Median follow-up was 
63.7 months. ORR was 71.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.8-77.4; CR, 27.6%; 
partial response, 43.8%). Median duration of response (DOR) was 16.6 months;

including half of complete responders, maintained response ≥4 years. Median 
overall survival was not reached. Among 20 patients receiving second-course 
pembrolizumab, ORR for 19 evaluable patients was 73.7% (95% CI, 48.8-90.8); 
median DOR was 15.2 months. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred 
in 72.9% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 12.9%; no treatment-related deaths

several subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in first remission. 
However, many patients relapse after ASCT and have a very poor prognosis. There 
are no approved treatment options for post-transplant maintenance or 
consolidation in PTCL. PD-1 blockade has demonstrated some efficacy for patients 
with PTCL. We therefore conducted a phase 2 multicenter study of the anti-PD-1 
monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab after ASCT in patients with PTCL in first 
remission. Pembrolizumab was administered at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 8 
cycles within 21 days from post-ASCT discharge (and within 60 days of stem cell 
infusion). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 months 
post-ASCT. Twenty-one patients were treated on this study and (14) 67% completed 
8 cycles of treatment. Among all evaluable patients, 13/21 were alive and 
progression-free at 18-months post-ASCT, meeting the study's primary endpoint. 
The estimated 18-month PFS was 83.6% (95% CI: 68 - 100), and OS 94.4% (95% CI: 
84 - 100). The toxicity profile was consistent with the known toxicity profile 
of pembrolizumab with no grade 5 toxicities. In conclusion, PD-1 blockade after 
ASCT with pembrolizumab is feasible with a favorable safety profile and 
promising activity, supporting further confirmatory studies. This trial was

increasing research interest in biology and medicine. Despite extensive studies, 
a question still remains as to how effects of application of nsPEF on 
intracellular functions are different between cancerous cells and normal cells 
and how the difference can be detected. Herein, we have presented an approach of 
autofluorescence lifetime (AFL) microscopy of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) 
to detect effects of application of nsPEF having 50 ns of a pulse width, 
nsPEF(50), on intracellular function in lung cancerous cells, A549 and H661, 
which show nsPEF(50)-induced apoptosis, and normal cells, MRC-5, in which the 
field effect is less or not induced. Then, the application of nsPEF(50) is shown 
to increase the lifetime of FAD autofluorescence in lung cancerous cells, 
whereas the electric field effects on the autofluorescence of FAD was not 
significant in normal healthy cells, which indicates that the lifetime 
measurements of FAD autofluorescence are applicable to detect the field-induced 
change in intracellular functions. Lifetime and intensity microscopic images of 
FAD autofluorescence in these lung cells were also acquired after exposure to 
the apoptosis-inducer staurosporine (STS). Then, it was found that the AFL of 
FAD became longer after exposure not only in the cancerous cells but also in the 
normal cells. These results indicate that nsPEF(50) applied to lung cells 
induced apoptotic cell death only in lung cancerous cells (H661 and A549) but 
not in lung normal cells (MRC-5), whereas STS induced apoptotic cell death both 
in lung cancerous cells and in lung normal cells. The lifetime microscopy of FAD 
autofluorescence is suggested to be very useful as a sensitive detection method 
of nsPEF-induced apoptotic cell death.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c01148

acetyltransferases. A major member of this enzyme family, NatB, acts on much of 
the human proteome, including α-synuclein (αS), a synaptic protein that mediates 
vesicle trafficking. NatB acetylation of αS modulates its lipid vesicle binding 
properties and amyloid fibril formation, which underlies its role in the 
pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Although the molecular details of the 
interaction between human NatB (hNatB) and the N-terminus of αS have been 
resolved, whether the remainder of the protein plays a role in interacting with 
the enzyme is unknown. Here, we execute the first synthesis, by native chemical 
ligation, of a bisubstrate inhibitor of NatB consisting of coenzyme A and 
full-length human αS, additionally incorporating two fluorescent probes for 
studies of conformational dynamics. We use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 
characterize the structural features of the hNatB/inhibitor complex and show 
that, beyond the first few residues, αS remains disordered when in complex with 
hNatB. We further probe changes in the αS conformation by single molecule 
Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to reveal that the C-terminus expands 
when bound to hNatB. Computational models based on the cryo-EM and smFRET data 
help to explain the conformational changes as well as their implications for 
hNatB substrate recognition and specific inhibition of the interaction with αS. 
Beyond the study of αS and NatB, these experiments illustrate valuable 
strategies for the study of challenging structural biology targets through a 
combination of protein semi-synthesis, cryo-EM, smFRET, and computational 
modeling.","DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c03887

(ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline lowered the threshold defining 
hypertension to 130/80 mmHg. However, how stage 1 hypertension defined using 
this guideline is associated with cardiovascular events in Chinese adults 
remains unclear. This study assessed the association between stage 1 
hypertension defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and clinical outcomes in the 
Chinese population.
METHODS: Participants with stage 1 hypertension (n = 69,509) or normal BP (n = 
34,142) were followed in this study from 2006/2007 to 2020. Stage 1 hypertension 
was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130-139 mmHg or a diastolic blood 
pressure of 80-89 mmHg. None were taking antihypertensive medication or had a 
history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or cancer at baseline. The 
primary outcome was a composite of MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality. The 
secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome. Cox 
proportional hazards models were used for the analysis.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.09 years, we observed 10,479 events 
(MI, n = 995; stroke, n = 3408; all-cause mortality, n = 7094). After 
multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratios for stage 1 hypertension vs. normal 
BP were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.25) for primary outcome, 1.24 
(95% CI, 1.05-1.46) for MI, 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.59) for stroke, and 1.11 (95% 
CI, 1.04-1.17) for all-cause mortality. The hazard ratios for participants with 
stage 1 hypertension who were prescribed antihypertensive medications compared 
with those without antihypertensive treatment during the follow-up was 0.90 (95% 
CI, 0.85-0.96).
CONCLUSION: Using the new definition, Chinese adults with untreated stage 1 
hypertension are at higher risk for MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality. This 
finding may help to validate the new BP classification system in China.","Copyright © 2023 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer,

treatment of localized prostate cancer. Using results from the European Society 
of Radiation Oncology's (ESTRO) Global Impact of Radiotherapy in Oncology (GIRO) 
initiative survey on hypofractionation, this study identifies rates of adoption, 
facilitating factors, and barriers to adoption of hypofractionation in prostate 
cancer across World Bank income groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ESTRO-GIRO initiative administered an international, 
anonymous, electronic survey to radiation oncologists from 2018 to 2019. 
Physician demographics, clinical practice characteristics, and hypofractionation 
regimen use (if any) for several prostate cancer scenarios were collected. 
Responders were asked about specific justifications and barriers to adopting 
hypofractionation, and responses were stratified by World Bank income group. 
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze variables 
associated with hypofractionation preference.
RESULTS: A total of 1,157 physician responses were included. Most respondents 
(60%) were from high-income countries (HICs). In the curative setting, 
hypofractionation was most often preferred in low- and intermediate-risk 
prostate cancers, with 52% and 47% of respondents reporting hypofractionation 
use in ≥50% of patients, respectively. These rates drop to 35% and 20% in 
high-risk prostate cancer and where pelvic irradiation is indicated. Most 
respondents (89%) preferred hypofractionation in the palliative setting. 
Overall, respondents from upper-middle-income countries and lower-middle- and 
low-income countries were significantly less likely to prefer hypofractionation 
than those from HICs (P < .001). The most frequently cited justification and 
barrier were availability of published evidence and fear of worse late toxicity, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Hypofractionation preference varies by indication and World Bank 
income group, with greater acceptance among providers in HICs for all 
indications. These results provide a basis for targeted interventions to 
increase provider acceptance of this treatment modality.","DOI: 10.1200/GO.23.00046

literature, including characterizations of its risk factors, manifestations, and 
consequences. There is, however, limited research on interventions, particularly 
those at the hospital level, to address the issue.
METHODS: From March 1, 2019, to February 28, 2022, a multidisciplinary team 
conducted a three-cycle Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) process to develop, test, and 
implement an electronic medical record (EMR) order set to directly refer 
patients to a hospital-based financial assistance program. The cycles included 
an assessment of the efficacy of our current practice in connecting patients 
experiencing financial hardship with assistance, the development and piloting of 
the EMR referral order, and the broad implementation of the order set across our 
institution.
RESULTS: In PDSA cycle 1, we found that approximately 25% of patients at our 
institution experienced some form of financial hardship, but most patients were 
not connected to available resources because of our referral mechanism. In PDSA 
cycle 2, the pilot referral order set was deemed feasible and received positive 
feedback. Over the 12-month study period (March 1, 2021-February 28, 2022) of 
PDSA cycle 3, 718 orders were placed for 670 unique patients across 
interdisciplinary providers from 55 treatment areas. These referrals resulted in 
at least $850,000 in US dollars (USD) in financial aid in 38 patients (mean = 
$22,368 USD).
CONCLUSION: The findings from our three-cycle PDSA quality improvement project 
demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of interdisciplinary efforts to develop 
a hospital-level financial toxicity intervention. A simple referral mechanism 
can empower providers to connect patients in need with available resources.","DOI: 10.1200/OP.22.00669

racial/ethnic groups, yet the role of germline genetic predisposition in EOCRC 
disparities remains uncharacterized. We defined the prevalence and spectrum of 
inherited colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility gene variations among patients 
with EOCRC by race and ethnicity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included individuals diagnosed with a first primary CRC 
between age 15 and 49 years who identified as Ashkenazi Jewish, Asian, Black, 
Hispanic, or White and underwent germline genetic testing of 14 CRC 
susceptibility genes performed by a clinical testing laboratory. Variant 
comparisons by racial and ethnic groups were evaluated using chi-square tests 
and multivariable logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, CRC site, and 
number of primary colorectal tumors.
RESULTS: Among 3,980 patients with EOCRC, a total of 530 germline pathogenic or 
likely pathogenic variants were identified in 485 individuals (12.2%). By 
race/ethnicity, 12.7% of Ashkenazim patients, 9.5% of Asian patients, 10.3% of 
Black patients, 14.0% of Hispanic patients, and 12.4% of White patients carried 
a germline variant. The prevalence of Lynch syndrome (P = .037), as well as APC, 
CHEK2, MLH1, monoallelic MUTYH, and PTEN variants, varied by race/ethnicity 
among patients with EOCRC (all P < .026). Ashkenazim and Hispanic patients had 
significantly higher odds of presenting with a pathogenic APC variant, which 
included p.I1307K (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% CI, 1.30 to 5.49; P = .007) and 
MLH1 variant (OR, 8.69; 95% CI, 2.68 to 28.20; P = .0003), respectively, versus 
White patients in adjusted models.
CONCLUSION: Germline genetic features differed by race/ethnicity in young 
patients with CRC, suggesting that current multigene panel tests may not be 
representative of EOCRC risk in diverse populations. Further study is needed to 
optimize genes selected for genetic testing in EOCRC via ancestry-specific gene 
and variant discovery to yield equitable clinical benefits for all patients and 
to mitigate inequities in disease burden.","DOI: 10.1200/JCO.22.02378

patients, but outcomes remain poor for patients experiencing disease progression 
or relapse (refractory or relapsed DLBCL [rrDLBCL]), particularly if these 
events occur early. Although previous studies examining cohorts of rrDLBCL have 
identified features that are enriched at relapse, few have directly compared 
serial biopsies to uncover biological and evolutionary dynamics driving rrDLBCL. 
Here, we sought to confirm the relationship between relapse timing and outcomes 
after second-line (immuno)chemotherapy and determine the evolutionary dynamics 
that underpin that relationship.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Outcomes were examined in a population-based cohort of 221 
patients with DLBCL who experienced progression/relapse after frontline 
treatment and were treated with second-line (immuno)chemotherapy with an 
intention-to-treat with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Serial 
DLBCL biopsies from a partially overlapping cohort of 129 patients underwent 
molecular characterization, including whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing in 
73 patients.
RESULTS: Outcomes to second-line therapy and ASCT are superior for late relapse 
(>2 years postdiagnosis) versus primary refractory (<9 months) or early relapse 
(9-24 months). Diagnostic and relapse biopsies were mostly concordant for 
cell-of-origin classification and genetics-based subgroup. Despite this 
concordance, the number of mutations exclusive to each biopsy increased with 
time since diagnosis, and late relapses shared few mutations with their 
diagnostic counterpart, demonstrating a branching evolution pattern. In patients 
with highly divergent tumors, many of the same genes acquired new mutations 
independently in each tumor, suggesting that the earliest mutations in a shared 
precursor cell constrain tumor evolution toward the same genetics-based 
subgroups at both diagnosis and relapse.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that late relapses commonly represent 
genetically distinct and chemotherapy-naïve disease and have implications for 
optimal patient management.","DOI: 10.1200/JCO.23.00570

in tumor development and immunotherapy. The study investigated cross-talk and 
RNA modification roles in the TME, cancer stemness, and immunotherapy of gastric 
cancer (GC).
METHODS: We applied an unsupervised clustering method to distinguish RNA 
modification patterns in GC. GSVA and ssGSEA algorithms were applied. The 
WM_Score model was constructed for evaluating the RNA modification-related 
subtypes. Also, we conducted an association analysis between the WM_Score and 
biological and clinical features in GC and explored the WM_Score model's 
predictive value in immunotherapy.
RESULTS: We identified four RNA modification patterns with diverse survival and 
TME features. One pattern consistent with the immune-inflamed tumor phenotype 
showed a better prognosis. Patients in WM_Score high group were related to 
adverse clinical outcomes, immune suppression, stromal activation, and enhanced 
cancer stemness, while WM_Score low group showed opposite results. The WM_Score 
was correlated with genetic, epigenetic alterations, and post-transcriptional 
modifications in GC. Low WM_Score was related to enhanced efficacy of 
anti-PD-1/L1 immunotherapy.

(DCE-MRI) can improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer screening in 
patients who have dense breasts or are at high risk of breast cancer. However, 
the spatiotemporal resolution of DCE-MRI is limited by technical issues in 
clinical practice. Our earlier work demonstrated the use of image reconstruction 
with enhancement-constrained acceleration (ECA) to increase temporal resolution. 
ECA exploits the correlation in k-space between successive image acquisitions. 
Because of this correlation, and due to the very sparse enhancement at early 
times after contrast media injection, we can reconstruct images from highly 
under-sampled k-space data. Our previous results showed that ECA reconstruction 
at 0.25 seconds per image (4 Hz) can estimate bolus arrival time (BAT) and 
initial enhancement slope (iSlope) more accurately than a standard inverse fast 
Fourier transform (IFFT) when k-space data is sampled following a Cartesian 
based sampling trajectory with adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this 
follow-up study, we investigated the effect of different Cartesian based 
sampling trajectories, SNRs and acceleration rates on the performance of ECA 
reconstruction in estimating contrast media kinetics in lesions (BAT, iSlope and 
Ktrans) and in arteries (Peak signal intensity of first pass, time to peak, and 
BAT). We further validated ECA reconstruction with a flow phantom experiment. 
Our results show that ECA reconstruction of k-space data acquired with 
'Under-sampling with Repeated Advancing Phase' (UnWRAP) trajectories with an 
acceleration factor of 14, and temporal resolution of 0.5 s/image and high SNR 
(SNR ≥ 30 dB, noise standard deviation (std) < 3%) ensures minor errors (5% or 1 
s error) in lesion kinetics. Medium SNR (SNR ≥ 20 dB, noise std ≤ 10%) was 
needed to accurately measure arterial enhancement kinetics. Our results also 
suggest that accelerated temporal resolution with ECA with 0.5 s/image is 
practical.","Copyright: © 2023 Ren et al. This is an open access article distributed under

around 14.2% (n = 29)(P> 0.01) pediatric diarrheoal cases were screened as 
shigellosis. Another interesting finding was that most of shigellosis affected 
children were 7 months to 1 year (P> 0.01).The significance of this study lies 
in the analyses of the occurrenceand the molecular identification of 
Shigellaspp. and S. flexneri that can be utilized in improving the accurate 
identification and the treatment of the most severe and alarming shigellosis.","Copyright: © 2023 Zakir Hossain et al. This is an open access article

(1)Cancer Signaling and Microenvironment Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, 
Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.","Classic homocystinuria is an inborn error of metabolism caused mainly by 
missense mutations leading to misfolded and/or unstable human cystathionine 
β-synthase (CBS) protein, causing the accumulation of excess total homocysteine 
(tHcy) in tissues. Previously, it has been shown that certain missense 
containing human CBS proteins can be functionally rescued in mouse models of CBS 
deficiency by treatment with proteasome inhibitors. The rescue by proteasome 
inhibitors is thought to work both by inhibiting the degradation of misfolded 
CBS protein and by inducing the levels of heat-shock chaperone proteins in the 
liver. Here we examine the effectiveness of two FDA approved protease 
inhibitors, carfilzomib and bortezomib, on various transgenic mouse models of 
human CBS deficiency. Our results show that although both drugs are effective in 
inducing the liver chaperone proteins Hsp70 and Hsp27, and are effective in 
inhibiting proteasome function, bortezomib was somewhat more robust in restoring 
the mutant CBS function. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between 
proteasome inhibition and CBS activity, suggesting that some of bortezomib's 
effects are via other mechanisms. We also test the use of low-doses of 
bortezomib and carfilzomib on various mouse models for extended periods of time 
and find that while low-doses are less toxic, they are also less effective at 
restoring CBS function. Overall, these results show that while restoration of 
mutant CBS function is possible with proteasome inhibitors, the exact mechanism 
is complicated and it will likely be too toxic for long-term patient treatment.","Copyright: © 2023 Gupta et al. This is an open access article distributed under

under immunosuppressive treatment. BK polyomavirus is implicated in cancer 
development and invasion, and case reports of renal cell carcinoma and 
urothelial carcinoma possibly associated with BK polyomavirus has been reported. 
Further, it has been suggested that the immune responses of KT-related diseases 
could play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of renal cell carcinoma. 
Thus, we thought to examine the relationship between BK polyomavirus-associated 
nephropathy and renal cell carcinoma in terms of gene expression. To identify 
the common and specific immune responses involved in kidney 
transplantation-related diseases with a specific focus on BK 
polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, we performed consensus weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis on gene profile datasets of renal biopsy samples 
from different institutions. After the identification of gene modules and 
validation of the obtained network by immunohistochemistry of the marker across 
kidney transplantation-related diseases, the relationship between prognosis of 
renal cell carcinoma and modules was assessed. We included the data from 248 
patients and identified the 14 gene clusters across the datasets. We revealed 
that one cluster related to the translation regulating process and DNA damage 
response was specifically upregulated in BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy. 
There was a significant association between the expression value of hub genes of 
the identified cluster including those related to cGAS-STING pathway and DNA 
damage response, and the prognosis of renal cell carcinoma. The study suggested 
the potential link between kidney transplantation-related diseases, especially

Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.","INTRODUCTION: Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is defined as the replacement 
of the normal gastric epithelium by intestinal-type epithelium. GIM is 
considered a pre-neoplastic lesion for gastric adenocarcinoma in adults and is 
found in 25% of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) exposed adults. However, the 
significance of GIM in pediatric gastric biopsies is still unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of children with GIM on gastric 
biopsies at Boston Children's Hospital between January 2013-July 2019. 
Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic data were collected and 
compared to age and sex-matched cohort without GIM. Gastric biopsies were 
reviewed by the study pathologist. GIM was classified as complete/incomplete 
based on Paneth cell presence or absence and limited/extensive based on its 
distribution in the antrum or both antrum and corpus.
RESULTS: Of 38 patients with GIM, 18 were male (47%), mean age of detection was 
12.5 ± 5.05 years (range, 1-18 years). The most common histologic was chronic 
gastritis (47%). Complete GIM was present in 50% (19/38) and limited GIM was 
present in 92% (22/24). H. pylori was positive in 2 patients. Two patients had 
persistent GIM on repeat EGD (2/12). No dysplasia or carcinoma was identified. 
Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and chronic gastritis were more common in GIM 
patients compared to control (p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: Most children with GIM had low-risk histologic subtype 
(complete/limited) for gastric cancer; GIM was rarely associated with H. pylori 
gastritis in our cohort. Larger multicenter studies are needed to better 
understand outcomes and risk factors in children with GIM.","Copyright © 2023 by European Society for European Society for Pediatric

confined to previously irradiated areas that are most commonly triggered by the 
administration of anti-cancer agents after radiotherapy. Radiation recall 
myositis is a relatively rare form of radiation recall reaction.
CASE REPORT: Here we report a 29-year-old female patient who suffered from 
metastatic monophasic synovial sarcoma. 8.5 months after post-operative 
radiotherapy of the right thigh region, the patient suffered pain, edema, 
redness, and increased temperature locally on the right thigh. Physical exam 
showed red fixed skin, rigidity and severe tenderness of region, and thigh 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed dense edema areas at the addiction, 
semimembranous-semitendinous muscle, and superior part of the biceps femoris and 
vastus lateralis isointense on T1AG, hyperintense T2AG images. Based on these 
findings, the patient was diagnosed with pazopanib-induced radiation recall 
myositis.
MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Pazopanib was stopped and pentoxifylline (2  × 400 mg), 
Vitamin E (3  × 400 mg), and methylprednisolone (2  × 8 mg) were prescribed. 
After 1 month, complete relief of thigh pain and marked recovery of rigidity, as 
well as erythema, were achieved and no recurrence of radiation recall 
reaction-related symptoms was observed after the pazopanib rechallenge.
DISCUSSION: Myositis is a relatively rare presentation of radiation recall 
reaction and physicians must be aware of the symptoms of the patients who are 
treated by radiotherapy and pazopanib.","DOI: 10.1177/10781552221125869

pathogens but also prevents the emergence of pathological self-reactive immune 
cells. The disruption of immune homeostasis leads to the development of various 
diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. An emerging paradigm for the 
treatment of these diseases with dysfunctional immune systems is the restoration 
and maintenance of immune homeostasis. However, currently available drugs exert 
a unidirectional influence on immunity whereby they either augment or inhibit 
it. This strategy is associated with the drawback of potential adverse effects 
arising from uncontrolled activation or suppression of the immune system. 
Fortunately, evidence suggests that acupuncture can bi-directionally regulate 
the immune system to maintain immune homeostasis. In cases of immunosuppressive 
diseases (e.g., cancer), acupuncture has an enhancing effect on immunity. 
Conversely, in autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), acupuncture has 
been observed to have an immunosuppressive effect, which helps restore normal 
immune tolerance. However, there is no publication systematically summarising 
the bidirectional regulatory effects of acupuncture on the immune system in the 
literature. Here, our review provides a comprehensive overview of the various 
mechanisms through which acupuncture modulates the immune system in a 
bidirectional manner. These mechanisms include the augmentation of NK and CD8+T 
cell function, as well as the restoration of Th1/Th2, Th17/Treg, and M1/M2 
balance. Thus, we propose the concept that acupuncture has the potential to 
alleviate illnesses through the facilitation of immune normalization. Moreover, 
we further highlight the therapeutic potential of acupuncture.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

clinically relevant applications using clinically significant samples and 
models. We discuss the use of RS both as a label-free approach for probing the 
intrinsic metabolites of biological materials, and as a labeled approach where 
signal from Raman reporters conjugated to nanoparticles (NPs) serve as an 
indirect measure for tracking protein biomarkers in vivo and for high throughout 
proteomics. We summarize the use of machine learning algorithms for processing 
RS data to allow accurate detection and evaluation of treatment response 
specifically focusing on cancer, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and 
neurodegenerative diseases. We also highlight the integration of RS with 
established omics approaches for holistic diagnostic information. Further, we 
elaborate on metal-free NPs that leverage the biological Raman-silent region 
overcoming the challenges of traditional metal NPs. We conclude the review with 
an outlook on future directions that will ultimately allow the adaptation of RS

patients with brain metastases (BMs). However, damage to the healthy brain may 
limit the tumor dose for patients with multiple lesions.
PURPOSE: In this study, we investigate the potential of spatiotemporal 
fractionation schemes to reduce the biological dose received by the healthy 
brain in SRS of multiple BMs, and also demonstrate a novel concept of 
spatiotemporal fractionation for polymetastatic cancer patients that faces less 
hurdles for clinical implementation.
METHODS: Spatiotemporal fractionation (STF) schemes aim at partial 
hypofractionation in the metastases along with more uniform fractionation in the 
healthy brain. This is achieved by delivering distinct dose distributions in 
different fractions, which are designed based on their cumulative biologically 
effective dose ( BEDα/β ) such that each fraction contributes with high doses to 
complementary parts of the target volume, while similar dose baths are delivered 
to the normal tissue. For patients with multiple brain metastases, a novel 
constrained approach to spatiotemporal fractionation (cSTF) is proposed, which 
is more robust against setup and biological uncertainties. The approach aims at 
irradiating entire metastases with possibly different doses, but spatially 
similar dose distributions in every fraction, where the optimal dose 
contribution of every fraction to each metastasis is determined using a new 
planning objective to be added to the BED-based treatment plan optimization 
problem. The benefits of spatiotemporal fractionation schemes are evaluated for 
three patients, each with >25 BMs.
RESULTS: For the same tumor BED10 and the same brain volume exposed to high 
doses in all plans, the mean brain BED2 can be reduced compared to uniformly 
fractionated plans by 9%-12% with the cSTF plans and by 13%-19% with the STF 
plans. In contrast to the STF plans, the cSTF plans avoid partial irradiation of 
the individual metastases and are less sensitive to misalignments of the 
fractional dose distributions when setup errors occur.
CONCLUSION: Spatiotemporal fractionation schemes represent an approach to lower 
the biological dose to the healthy brain in SRS-based treatments of multiple 
BMs. Although cSTF cannot achieve the full BED reduction of STF, it improves on 
uniform fractionation and is more robust against both setup errors and 
biological uncertainties related to partial tumor irradiation.","© 2023 The Authors. Medical Physics published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf

peroxidation, with cysteine metabolism and glutathione-dependent antioxidant 
defence responses as the primary triggering mechanisms. Ferroptosis is an 
independent tumour suppression mechanism and has been implicated in various 
disorders. In tumourigenesis, ferroptosis plays a dual role in promoting and 
inhibiting tumours. P53, NFE2L2, BAP1, HIF, and other tumour suppressor genes 
regulate ferroptosis, releasing damage-associated molecular patterns or lipid 
metabolites to influence cellular immune responses. Ferroptosis is also involved 
in tumour suppression and metabolism. The combination of amino acid, lipid, and 
iron metabolism is involved in the initiation and execution of ferroptosis, and 
metabolic regulatory mechanisms also play roles in malignancies. Most 
investigations into ferroptosis in gastric cancer are concentrated on predictive 
models, not the underlying processes. This review investigates the underlying 
mechanisms of ferroptosis, tumour suppressor genes, and the tumour 
microenvironment.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000817

colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis. In the present 
study, we unravel a novel mechanism by which LIN28B regulates colonic epithelial 
cell-cell junctions and CRC metastasis. Using human CRC cells (DLD-1, Caco-2 and 
LoVo) with either knockdown or overexpression of LIN28B, we identified Claudin 1 
(CLDN1) tight junction protein as a direct downstream target and effector of 
LIN28B. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that LIN28B directly binds to and 
post-transcriptionally regulates CLDN1 mRNA. Furthermore, using in vitro assays 
and a novel murine model of metastatic CRC, we show that LIN28B-mediated CLDN1 
expression enhances collective invasion, cell migration, and metastatic liver 
tumor formation. Bulk RNA-sequencing of the metastatic liver tumors identified 
NOTCH3 as a downstream effector of the LIN28B-CLDN1 axis. Additionally, genetic 
and pharmacologic manipulation of NOTCH3 signaling revealed that NOTCH3 was 
necessary for invasion and metastatic liver tumor formation. In summary, our 
results suggest that LIN28B promotes invasion and liver metastasis of CRC by 
post-transcriptionally regulating CLDN1 and activating NOTCH3 signaling. This 
discovery offers a promising new therapeutic option for metastatic CRC to the 
liver, an area where therapeutic advancements have been relatively scarce.","DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.167310

bladder cancers. It is common and costly. Cost and detriment to patient outcomes 
and quality of life are driven by high recurrence rates and the need for regular 
invasive surveillance and repeat treatments. There is evidence that the quality 
of the initial surgical procedure (transurethral resection of bladder tumor 
[TURBT]) and administration of postoperative bladder chemotherapy significantly 
reduce cancer recurrence rates and improve outcomes (cancer progression and 
mortality). There is surgeon-reported evidence that TURBT practice varies 
significantly across surgeons and sites. There is limited evidence from clinical 
trials of intravesical chemotherapy that NMIBC recurrence rate varies 
significantly between sites and that this cannot be accounted for by differences 
in patient, tumor, or adjuvant treatment factors, suggesting that how the 
surgery is performed may be a reason for the variation.
OBJECTIVE: This study primarily aims to determine if feedback on and education 
about surgical quality indicators can improve performance and secondarily if 
this can reduce cancer recurrence rates. Planned secondary analyses aim to 
determine what surgeon, operative, perioperative, institutional, and patient 
factors are associated with better achievement of TURBT quality indicators and 
NMIBC recurrence rates.
METHODS: This is an observational, international, multicenter study with an 
embedded cluster randomized trial of audit, feedback, and education. Sites will 
be included if they perform TURBT for NMIBC. The study has four phases: (1) site 
registration and usual practice survey; (2) retrospective audit; (3) 
randomization to audit, feedback, and education intervention or to no 
intervention; and (4) prospective audit. Local and national ethical and 
institutional approvals or exemptions will be obtained at each participating 
site.
RESULTS: The study has 4 coprimary outcomes, which are 4 evidence-based TURBT 
quality indicators: a surgical performance factor (detrusor muscle resection); 
an adjuvant treatment factor (intravesical chemotherapy administration); and 2 
documentation factors (resection completeness and tumor features). A key 
secondary outcome is the early cancer recurrence rate. The intervention is a 
web-based surgical performance feedback dashboard with educational and practical 
resources for TURBT quality improvement. It will include anonymous site and 
surgeon-level peer comparison, a performance summary, and targets. The coprimary 
outcomes will be analyzed at the site level while recurrence rate will be 
analyzed at the patient level. The study was funded in October 2020 and began 
data collection in April 2021. As of January 2023, there were 220 hospitals 
participating and over 15,000 patient records. Projected data collection end 
date is June 30, 2023.
CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to use a distributed collaborative model to deliver 
a site-level web-based performance feedback intervention to improve the quality 
of endoscopic bladder cancer surgery. The study is funded and projects to 
complete data collection in June 2023.

tissues are common. Here we analyzed cell-free, methylated DNA released from 
dying cells into the circulation to evaluate radiation-induced cellular damages 
in different tissues. To map the circulating DNA fragments to human and mouse 
tissues, we established sequencing-based, cell-type specific reference DNA 
methylation atlases. We found that cell-type specific DNA blocks were mostly 
hypomethylated and located within signature genes of cellular identity. 
Cell-free DNA fragments were captured from serum samples by hybridization to 
CpG-rich DNA panels and mapped to the DNA methylation atlases. In a mouse model, 
thoracic radiation-induced tissue damages were reflected by dose-dependent 
increases in lung endothelial and cardiomyocyte methylated DNA in serum. The 
analysis of serum samples from breast cancer patients undergoing radiation 
treatment revealed distinct dose-dependent and tissue-specific epithelial and 
endothelial responses to radiation across multiple organs. Strikingly, patients 
treated for right-sided breast cancers also showed increased hepatocyte and 
liver endothelial DNA in the circulation indicating the impact on liver tissues. 
Thus, changes in cell-free methylated DNA can uncover cell-type specific effects 
of radiation and provide a readout of the biologically effective radiation dose

model for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LA-ESCC).The 
objective of this study aimed to assessed the impact of additional neoadjuvant 
immunotherapy on patients' short-term outcomes, particularly the incidence of 
anastomotic leakage (AL) and pathological response.
METHODS: Patients with LA-ESCC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy(nCT)/ nICT 
combination with radical esophagectomy were enrolled from three medical centers 
in China. We used propensity score matching (PSM， ration：1:1, caliper=0.01) and 
inverse probability processing weighting (IPTW) to balance the baseline 
characteristics and compare the outcomes. Conditional logistic regression and 
weighted logistic regression analysis were used to further evaluate whether 
additional neoadjuvant immunotherapy would increased the risk of postoperative 
AL.
RESULTS: A total of 331 patients getting partially advanced ESCC receiving nCT 
or nICT were enrolled from three medical centers in China. After PSM/IPTW, the 
baseline characteristics reached a equilibrium between the two groups. After 
matching, there were no significant difference in the AL incidence between the 
two groups(P=0.68, after PSM; P=0.97 after IPTW), and the incidence of AL in the 
two groups was 15.85% versus 18.29%, and 14.79% versus 15.01%, respectively. 
After PSM/IPTW, both groups were similar in pleural effusion and pneumonia. 
After IPTW, the nICT group had a higher incidence of bleeding(3.36% vs. 0.30%, 
P=0.01), chylothorax(5.79% 0.30%, P=0.001), and cardiac events(19.53% vs. 9.20%, 
P=0.04). recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy(7.85% vs. 0.54%, P=0.003). After PSM, 
both groups were similar in palsy of recurrent laryngeal nerve(1.22% vs. 3.66%, 
P=0.31) and cardiac events(19.51% vs. 14.63%, P=0.41). Weighted logistic 
regression analysis showed that additional neoadjuvant immunotherapy wasn't 
responsible for AL (OR=0.56, 95%CI: [0.17,1.71], after PSM; 0.74, 95%CI: 
[0.34,1.56], after IPTW). The nICT group had dramatically higher pCR in primary 
tumor than the nCT group (P=0.003, PSM; P=0.005, IPTW), 9.76% versus 28.05% and 
7.72% versus 21.17%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional neoadjuvant immunotherapy could benefit pathological 
reactions without increasing the risk of AL and pulmonary complications.We 
require further randomized controlled research to validate whether additional 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy would make a difference in other complications, and 
determine whether pathologic benefits could translate into prognostic benefits, 
which would require longer follow-up.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000487

infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer as measured by computational 
deconvolution of bulk tumor transcriptomes.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Commonly assessed TILs, located in tumor stroma without 
direct contact with cancer cells (stromal TILs), correlate with breast cancer 
treatment response and survival. Clinical relevance of intratumoral TILs has 
been less studied partly due to their rarity, however, they may have 
non-negligible effects given their direct contact with cancer cells.
METHODS: 5,870 breast cancer patients from TCGA, METABRIC, GSE96058, GSE25066, 
GSE163882, GSE123845, and GSE20271 cohorts were analyzed and validated.
RESULTS: Intratumoral TIL score was established by the sum of all types of 
lymphocytes using the xCell algorithm. This score was highest in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) and lowest in the ER-positive/HER2-negative subtype. It 
correlated with cytolytic activity and infiltrations of dendritic cells, 
macrophages, and monocytes, and uniformly enriched immune-related gene sets 
regardless of subtype. Intratumoral TIL-high tumors correlated with higher 
mutation rates and significant cell proliferation on biological, pathological, 
and molecular analyses only in the ER-positive/HER2-negative subtype. It was 
significantly associated with pathological complete response (pCR) after 
anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in about half of the 
cohorts regardless of the subtype. Intratumoral TIL-high tumors correlated with 
better overall survival in HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes consistently in three 
cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral TILs estimated by transcriptome computation were 
associated with increased immune response and cell proliferation in 
ER-positive/HER2-negative and better survival in HER2-positive and TNBC 
subtypes, but not always with pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005954

challenge, a promising one-step platform for generating and delivering 
charge-reduced particles. Our approach uses a sharp electrode to produce ion 
wind, which reduces the cumulative charge in the particles and transports them 
to a target in front of the nozzle. We effectively controlled the morphologies 
of polymer products created from poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) at various 
concentrations. Our technique has also been proven safe for bioapplications, as 
evidenced by the delivery of PVDF particles onto breast cancer cells. The 
combination of simultaneous particle production and charge reduction, along with 
its direct delivery capability, makes the self-propelled EHDA a versatile 
technique for drug delivery applications.","DOI: 10.1021/acsami.3c02000

(HNC), there is limited literature on caregiver burden (CGB) and its evolution 
over treatment. Research is needed to address evidence gaps that exist in 
understanding the causal pathways between caregiving and treatment outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for CGB in 
HNC survivorship.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal prospective cohort study 
took place at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Dyads of 
treatment-naive patients with HNC and their caregivers were recruited between 
October 2019 and December 2020. Eligible patient-caregiver dyads were 18 years 
or older and fluent in English. Patients undergoing definitive treatment 
identified a caregiver as the primary, nonprofessional, nonpaid person who 
provided the most assistance to them. Among 100 eligible dyadic participants, 2 
caregivers declined participation, resulting in 96 enrolled participants. Data 
were analyzed from September 2021 through October 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants were surveyed at diagnosis, 3 months 
postdiagnosis, and 6 months postdiagnosis. Caregiver burden was evaluated with 
the 19-item Social Support Survey (scored 0-100, with higher scores indicating 
more support), Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA; scored 0-5, with higher 
scores on 4 subscales [disrupted schedule, financial problems, lack of family 
support, and health problems] indicating negative reactions, and higher scores 
on the fifth subscale [self-esteem] indicating favorable influence); and 3-item 
Loneliness Scale (scored 3-9, with higher scores indicating greater loneliness). 
Patient health-related quality of life was assessed using the University of 
Washington Quality of Life scale (UW-QOL; scored 0-100, with higher scores 
indicating better QOL).
RESULTS: Of the 96 enrolled participants, half were women (48 [50%]), and a 
majority were White (92 [96%]), married or living with a partner (81 [84%]), and 
working (51 [53%]). Of these participants, 60 (63%) completed surveys at 
diagnosis and at least 1 follow-up. Of the 30 caregivers, most were women (24 
[80%]), White (29 [97%]), married or living with a partner (28 [93%]), and 
working (22 [73%]). Caregivers of nonworking patients reported higher scores on 
the CRA subscale for health problems than caregivers of working patients (mean 
difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18-0.64). Caregivers of patients with UW-QOL 
social/emotional (S/E) subscale scores of 62 or lower at diagnosis reported 
increased scores on the CRA subscale for health problems (UW-QOL-S/E score of 
22: CRA score mean difference, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.48-1.77; UW-QOL-S/E score of 42: 
CRA score mean difference, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.34-1.15; and UW-QOL-S/E score of 62: 
CRA score mean difference, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14-0.59). Woman caregivers had 
statistically significant worsening scores on the Social Support Survey (mean 
difference, -9.18; 95% CI, -17.14 to -1.22). The proportion of lonely caregivers 
increased over treatment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study highlights patient- and 
caregiver-specific factors that are associated with increased CGB. Results 
further demonstrate the potential implications for negative health outcomes for 
caregivers of patients who are not working and have lower health-related quality 
of life.","DOI: 10.1001/jamaoto.2023.1283

prediction algorithms has received increased scrutiny, but there continues to be 
a lack of empirical studies addressing whether simply omitting race and 
ethnicity from the algorithms will ultimately affect decision-making for 
patients of minoritized racial and ethnic groups.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether including race and ethnicity as a predictor in a 
colorectal cancer recurrence risk algorithm is associated with racial bias, 
defined as racial and ethnic differences in model accuracy that could 
potentially lead to unequal treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective prognostic study was 
conducted using data from a large integrated health care system in Southern 
California for patients with colorectal cancer who received primary treatment 
between 2008 and 2013 and follow-up until December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed 
from January 2021 to June 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Four Cox proportional hazards regression prediction 
models were fitted to predict time from surveillance start to cancer recurrence: 
(1) a race-neutral model that explicitly excluded race and ethnicity as a 
predictor, (2) a race-sensitive model that included race and ethnicity, (3) a 
model with 2-way interactions between clinical predictors and race and 
ethnicity, and (4) separate models by race and ethnicity. Algorithmic fairness 
was assessed using model calibration, discriminative ability, false-positive and 
false-negative rates, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive 
value (NPV).
RESULTS: The study cohort included 4230 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [12.5] 
years; 2034 [48.1%] female; 490 [11.6%] Asian, Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander; 
554 [13.1%] Black or African American; 937 [22.1%] Hispanic; and 2249 [53.1%] 
non-Hispanic White). The race-neutral model had worse calibration, NPV, and 
false-negative rates among racial and ethnic minority subgroups than 
non-Hispanic White individuals (eg, false-negative rate for Hispanic patients: 
12.0% [95% CI, 6.0%-18.6%]; for non-Hispanic White patients: 3.1% [95% CI, 
0.8%-6.2%]). Adding race and ethnicity as a predictor improved algorithmic 
fairness in calibration slope, discriminative ability, PPV, and false-negative 
rates (eg, false-negative rate for Hispanic patients: 9.2% [95% CI, 3.9%-14.9%]; 
for non-Hispanic White patients: 7.9% [95% CI, 4.3%-11.9%]). Inclusion of race 
interaction terms or using race-stratified models did not improve model 
fairness, likely due to small sample sizes in subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study of the racial bias in a 
cancer recurrence risk algorithm, removing race and ethnicity as a predictor 
worsened algorithmic fairness in multiple measures, which could lead to 
inappropriate care recommendations for patients who belong to minoritized racial 
and ethnic groups. Clinical algorithm development should include evaluation of 
fairness criteria to understand the potential consequences of removing race and 
ethnicity for health inequities.","DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18495

quarterly clinic visits for HIV testing and drug refilling that are costly to 
health systems and clients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether 6-month PrEP dispensing supported with interim 
HIV self-testing (HIVST) results in noninferior PrEP continuation outcomes at 12 
months compared with standard quarterly clinic visits.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized noninferiority trial was 
conducted from May 2018 to May 2021 with 12 months of follow-up among PrEP 
clients aged 18 years or older who were returning for their first refill at a 
research clinic in Kiambu County, Kenya.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized 2:1 to (1) 6-month PrEP dispensing 
with semiannual clinic visits and interim HIVST at 3 months or (2) 
standard-of-care (SOC) PrEP delivery with 3-month dispensing, quarterly clinic 
visits, and clinic-based HIV testing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prespecified 12-month outcomes included recent HIV 
testing (any in past 6 months), PrEP refilling, and PrEP adherence (detectable 
tenofovir-diphosphate concentrations in dried blood spots). Binomial regression 
models were used to estimate risk differences (RDs), and a 1-sided 95% CI lower 
bound (LB) of -10% or greater was interpreted as noninferior.
RESULTS: A total of 495 participants were enrolled, with 329 enrolled in the 
intervention group and 166 enrolled in the SOC group; 330 (66.7%) were women, 
295 (59.6%) were in serodifferent relationships, and the median (IQR) age was 33 
(27-40) years. At 12 months, 241 individuals in the intervention group (73.3%) 
and 120 in the SOC group (72.3%) returned to clinic. In the intervention group, 
recent HIV testing was noninferior (230 individuals [69.9%]) compared with the 
SOC group (116 [69.9%]; RD, -0.33%, 95% CI LB, -7.44%). PrEP refilling in the 
intervention group (196 [59.6%]) was inconclusive compared with the SOC group 
(104 [62.7%]; RD, -3.25%; 95% CI LB, -10.84%), and PrEP adherence was 
noninferior in the intervention group (151 [45.9%]) compared with the SOC group 
(70 [42.2%]; RD, 4.96%; 95% CI LB, -2.46%). No HIV seroconversions were observed 
over the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis of secondary trial end points at 1 
year, semiannual PrEP dispensing with interim HIVST resulted in noninferior 
recent HIV testing and PrEP adherence compared with SOC quarterly PrEP 
dispensing. This novel model has the potential to optimize PrEP delivery.

Pathology (ASCCP) recommendations, regardless of age, women with high-risk 
infections other than human papillomavirus 16/18 positivity (other hrHPV) and 
negative cytology should not be referred directly to colposcopy. Several studies 
compared detection rates of ≥high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) 
between HPV 16/18 ± 45, and other hrHPV types on colposcopic biopsy.
METHODS: We designed a retrospective study to determine the presence of ≥HSIL in 
colposcopic biopsy in women with negative cytology and hrHPV positivity during 
the years 2016-2022.
RESULTS: HPV 16/18/45 had a PPV of 43.8%, while other hrHPV types had a PPV of 
29.1% for a tissue diagnosis of ≥HSIL. For a tissue diagnosis of ≥HSIL 
detection, there was no statistically significant difference between the PPV of 
other hrHPV and HPV 16/18/45 in patients ≥30. There were only two cases with a 
tissue diagnosis of ≥HSIL in the other hrHPV group of women under 30 years of 
age.
CONCLUSION: We suggested that the follow-up recommendations of ASCCP for 
patients above the age of 30 with negative cytology and other hrHPV positivity 
may not be fully applicable to countries like Turkey with a different healthcare 
environment. Referring to patients ≥30 who had other hrHPV positivity and 
negative cytology to direct colposcopy may be clinically beneficial, 
particularly in populations where a colposcopic examination is easy and

treatment in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) and metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC). This study evaluated biomarker testing in a nationwide 
database (NAT) versus the OneOncology (OneOnc) community network. Patients & 
methods: Patients with aNSCLC or mCRC with ≥1 biomarker test in a de-identified 
electronic health record-derived database were evaluated. OneOnc oncologists 
were surveyed. Results: Biomarker testing rates were high and comparable between 
OneOnc and NAT; next-generation sequencing (NGS) rates were higher at OneOnc. 
Patients with NGS versus other biomarker testing were more likely to receive 
targeted treatment. Operational challenges and insufficient tissue were barriers 
to NGS testing. Conclusion: Community cancer centers delivered personalized 
healthcare through biomarker testing.","Plain Language Summary: What is this article about? Cancer therapies often work 
better in certain subgroups of patients. Tumors may have characteristics that 
can predict which therapies may be more likely to work. These cancer biomarkers 
may be identified by special testing, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS). 
If a biomarker is detected, the patient can potentially be treated with medicine 
that targets that biomarker. This study looked at biomarker testing of lung and 
colon cancers in two community cancer practices (OneOncology [OneOnc] and 
nationwide database [NAT]). What were the results? The biomarker testing rates 
were high (≥81%) and similar between OneOnc and NAT. NGS testing rates were 
higher at OneOnc than at NAT (58 vs 49% for NSCLC, 55 vs 42% for metastatic 
colorectal cancer [mCRC]), suggesting the success of OneOnc's networkwide 
educational, pathway and operational programs. NGS testing was lower in 
community practices due to operational challenges and insufficient tissue 
collection. Patients who had NGS versus other biomarker testing were more likely 
to receive treatment specifically for that biomarker. However, some patients 
started treatment before their biomarker results were reported, usually because 
of their disease and a long wait time for biomarker test results. What do the 
results of the study mean? Community cancer centers can treat patients with 
targeted medicine based on biomarker testing results. There are opportunities to 
increase the number of patients getting NGS testing, shorten turnaround 
times and reduce the number of patients who start treatment before getting their 
biomarker test results.","DOI: 10.2217/fon-2022-1216

(LMICs), where resource limitations and cost often dictate treatment decisions. 
In this study, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for 
high-risk stage II and stage III colon cancer treatment in South Africa (ZA) and 
illustrate how such analyses can inform cancer treatment recommendations in a 
LMIC.
METHODS: We created a decision-analytic Markov model to compare lifetime costs 
and outcomes for patients with high-risk stage II and stage III colon cancer 
treated with three adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in a public hospital in ZA: 
capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) for 3 and 6 months, and capecitabine for 
6 months, compared to no adjuvant treatment. The primary outcome was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in international dollars (I$) per 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold equal to the 2021 ZA gross domestic product per capita (I$13,764/DALY 
averted).
RESULTS: CAPOX for 3 months was cost-effective for both patients with high-risk 
stage II and patients with stage III colon cancer (ICER = I$250/DALY averted and 
I$1042/DALY averted, respectively), compared to no adjuvant chemotherapy. In 
subgroup analyses of patients by tumor stage and number of positive lymph nodes, 
for patients with high-risk stage II colon cancer and T4 tumors, and patients 
with stage III colon cancer with T4 or N2 disease. CAPOX for 6 months was 
cost-effective and the optimal strategy. The optimal strategy in other settings 
will vary by local WTP thresholds. Decision analytic tools can be used to 
identify cost-effective cancer treatment strategies in resource-constrained 
settings.
CONCLUSION: Colon cancer incidence is increasing in low- and middle-income 
countries, including South Africa, where resource constraints can impact 
treatment decisions. This cost-effectiveness study evaluates three systemic 
adjuvant chemotherapy options, compared to surgery alone, for patients in South 
African public hospitals after surgical resection for high-risk stage II and

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Recent studies have uncovered the near-ubiquitous presence of 
microbes in solid tumors of diverse origins. Previous literature has shown the 
impact of specific bacterial species on the progression of cancer. We propose 
that local microbial dysbiosis enables certain cancer phenotypes through 
provisioning of essential metabolites directly to tumor cells.
METHODS: 16S rDNA sequencing of 75 patient lung samples revealed the lung tumor 
microbiome specifically enriched for bacteria capable of producing methionine. 
Wild-type (WT) and methionine auxotrophic (metA mutant) E. coli cells were used 
to condition cell culture media and the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD) cells were measured using SYTO60 staining. Further, colony forming assay, 
Annexin V Staining, BrdU, AlamarBlue, western blot, qPCR, LINE microarray and 
subcutaneous injection with methionine modulated feed were used to analyze 
cellular proliferation, cell-cycle, cell death, methylation potential, and 
xenograft formation under methionine restriction. Moreover, C14-labeled glucose 
was used to illustrate the interplay between tumor cells and bacteria.
RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Our results show bacteria found locally within the tumor 
microenvironment are enriched for methionine synthetic pathways, while having 
reduced S-adenosylmethionine metabolizing pathways. As methionine is one of nine 
essential amino acids that mammals are unable to synthesize de novo, we 
investigated a potentially novel function for the microbiome, supplying 
essential nutrients, such as methionine, to cancer cells. We demonstrate that 
LUAD cells can utilize methionine generated by bacteria to rescue phenotypes 
that would otherwise be inhibited due to nutrient restriction. In addition to 
this, with WT and metA mutant E. coli, we saw a selective advantage for bacteria 
with an intact methionine synthetic pathway to survive under the conditions 
induced by LUAD cells. These results would suggest that there is a potential 
bi-directional cross-talk between the local microbiome and adjacent tumor cells. 
In this study, we focused on methionine as one of the critical molecules, but we 
also hypothesize that additional bacterial metabolites may also be utilized by 
LUAD. Indeed, our radiolabeling data suggest that other biomolecules are shared 
between cancer cells and bacteria. Thus, modulating the local microbiome may 
have an indirect effect on tumor development, progression, and metastasis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s13402-023-00832-7

detection of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in gallbladder cancer (GBC). We 
aim to assess the GI involvement in GBC on CT and propose a CT-based 
classification.
METHODS: This retrospective study comprized consecutive patients with GBC who 
underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) for staging between 
January 2019 and April 2022. Two radiologists evaluated the CT images 
independently for the morphological type of GBC and the presence of GI 
involvement. GI involvement was classified into probable involvement, definite 
involvement and GI fistulization. The incidence of GI involvement and the 
association of GI involvement with the morphological type of GBC was evaluated. 
In addition, the inter-observer agreement for GI involvement was assessed.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 260 patients with GBC were evaluated. 
Forty-three (16.5%) patients had GI involvement. Probable GI involvement, 
definite GI involvement and GI fistulization were seen in 18 (41.9%), 19 (44.2%) 
and six (13.9%) patients, respectively. Duodenum was the most common site of 
involvement (55.8%), followed by hepatic flexure (23.3%), antropyloric region 
(9.3%) and transverse colon (2.3%). There was no association between GI 
involvement and morphological type of GBC. There was substantial to near-perfect 
agreement between the two radiologists for the overall GI involvement 
(k = 0.790), definite GI involvement (k = 0.815) and GI fistulization 
(k = 0.943). There was moderate agreement (k = 0.567) for probable GI 
involvement.
CONCLUSION: GBC frequently involves the GI tract and CT can be used to 
categorize the GI involvement. However, the proposed CT classification needs 
validation.",© 2023. Indian Society of Gastroenterology.,"DOI: 10.1007/s12664-023-01388-y

associated with high mortality rates on a global scale. Earlier investigations 
have revealed a critical role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in OC development, 
which is a new class of endogenous non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that reported to 
mediate progression of diverse tumor types. At present, the precise involvement 
of circRNAs and associated regulatory mechanisms in OC remain unknown. In this 
study, hsa_circ_0001741 expression patterns in OC cells and tissues were tested. 
The underlying regulatory pathways and targets were further explored with the 
aid of bioinformatics, luciferase reporter, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and 
cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) analyses. Further investigation of the 
hsa_circ_0001741 effects on tumor growth in vivo revealed abnormal circRNA 
expression in OC. hsa_circ_0001741 expression reduced in OC cells and tissues, 
indicative of activity in OC progression. hsa_circ_0001741 upregulation resulted 
in OC proliferation inhibitions. The luciferase reporter outputs verified 
miR-188-5p and FOXN2 as hsa_circ_0001741 downstream targets. FOXN2 silencing or 
miR-188-5p upregulations reversed inhibitory effects regarding hsa_circ_0001741 
on OC cell proliferation. Therefore our data suggested that hsa_circ_0001741 
upregulation inhibited proliferation of OC through modulatory effects on 
miR-188-5p/FOXN2 signaling.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death. The aim of this study 
was to explore the prognostic factors of LC and the influence of high fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) on LC survival. Data on LC patients were collected 
from 133 hospitals across 11 cities in Hebei Province from 2010 to 2015, and 
survival status was followed up until 2019. The personal PM2.5 exposure 
concentration (μg/m3) was matched according to the patient's registered address, 
calculated from a 5-year average for every patient, and stratified into 
quartiles. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS), 
and Cox's proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard 
ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS 
rates of the 6429 patients were 62.9%, 33.2%, and 15.2%, respectively. Advanced 
age (75 years or older: HR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.25-4.38), subsite at overlapping 
(HR = 4.35, 95% CI: 1.70-11.1), poor/undifferentiated differentiation (HR = 
1.71, 95% CI: 1.13-2.58), and advanced stages (stage III: HR = 2.53, 95% CI: 
1.60-4.00; stage IV: HR = 4.00, 95% CI: 2.63-6.09) were risk factors for 
survival, while receiving surgical treatment was a protective factor (HR = 0.60, 
95% CI: 0.44-0.83). Patients exposed to light pollution had the lowest risk of 
death with a 26-month median survival time. The risk of death in LC patients was 
greatest at PM2.5 concentrations of 98.7-108.9 μg/m3, especially for patients at 
advanced stage (HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.29-1.60). Our study indicates that the 
survival of LC is severely affected by relatively high levels of PM2.5 
pollution, especially in those with advanced-stage cancer.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

women and air pollution is obscure. The study aims to analyze the correlation 
between air pollution and the prevalence of breast and cervical cancer, and 
whether the gross domestic product (GDP) has a modifying effect on the impact of 
air pollution on the prevalence of breast and cervical cancer. Extracting panel 
data from 31 provinces and cities between 2006 and 2020, we evaluated the 
association between breast and cervical cancer prevalence and pollutant 
emissions from 2006 to 2015 with two-way fixed-effect models. We also analyzed 
the interaction between GDP and pollutant emissions and further check the 
robustness of the moderating effect results using group regression from 2016 to 
2020. Cluster robust standard errors were used to correct for the 
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. The coefficients of models show that the 
coefficients of logarithmic soot and dust emissions are estimated to be 
significantly positive, and the coefficients of their square terms are 
significantly negative. The robust results suggest that the relationship between 
soot and dust emissions and breast or cervical cancer prevalence is non-linear, 
from 2006 to 2015. In the analysis of particulate matter (PM) data in 2016-2020, 
the PM-GDP interaction term was also significantly negative, indicating that GDP 
growth weakened the effect of PM on the prevalence of breast cancer and cervical 
cancer. In provinces with higher GDP, the indirect effect of PM emissions 
concerning breast cancer is -0.396 while in provinces with lower GDP, it is 
about -0.215. The corresponding coefficient concerning cervical cancer is about 
-0.209 in provinces with higher GDP but not significant in provinces with lower 
GDP. Our results suggest that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between 
the prevalence of breast cancer and cervical cancer and air pollutants from 2006 
to 2015. GDP growth has a significant negative moderating effect on the impact 
of air pollutants on the prevalence of breast cancer and cervical cancer. PM 
emissions have a higher effect on the prevalence of breast and cervical cancer 
in provinces with higher GDP and a lower impact in provinces with lower GDP.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

from other epithelial head and neck cancer (HNC). There are 3 WHO subtypes, 
which considers the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and other 
histopathology features. Despite the survival benefit obtained from modern 
treatment modalities and techniques specifically in the local and locally 
advanced setting, a number of patients with this disease will recur and 
subsequently die of distant metastasis, locoregional relapse, or both. In the 
recurrent setting, the ideal therapy approach continues to be a topic of 
discussion and current recommendations are platinum-based combination 
chemotherapy. Phase III clinical trials which led to the approval of 
pembrolizumab or nivolumab for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
specifically excluded NPC. No immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, to date, has 
been approved by the FDA to treat NPC although the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) recommendations do include use of these agents. Hence, this 
remains the major challenge for treatment options. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is 
challenging as it is really 3 different diseases, and much research is required 
to determine best options and sequencing of those options. This article is going 
to address the data to date and discuss ongoing research in EBV + and EBV -

syndrome) predispose to colorectal (CRC) and endometrial (EC) cancer. However, 
mosaic variants in the MMR genes have been rarely described. We identified a 
likely de novo mosaic MSH6:c.1135_1139del p.Arg379* pathogenic variant in a 
patient diagnosed with suspected Lynch syndrome/Lynch-like syndrome. The patient 
developed MSH6-deficient EC and CRC at 54 and 58 years of age, respectively, 
without a detectable germline MMR pathogenic variant. Multigene panel sequencing 
of tumor and blood-derived DNA identified an MSH6 somatic mutation 
(MSH6:c.1135_1139del p.Arg379*) common to both the EC and CRC, raising suspicion 
of mosaicism. A droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay detected 
the MSH6 variant at 5.34% frequency in normal colonic tissue, 3.49% in saliva 
and 1.64% in blood DNA, demonstrating the presence of the MSH6 variant in all 
three germ layers. This study highlights the utility of tumor sequencing to 
guide sensitive ddPCR testing to detect low-level mosaicism in the MMR genes.

perforation (BP), and our protocol of management in patients who underwent 
trans-urethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).
METHODS: This is a retrospective study, between 2006 and 2020, on patients who 
underwent TURBT for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Bladder 
perforation was defined as any full thickness resection of the bladder wall. 
Bladder perforations were managed based on their severity and type. Small BP 
with no or mild symptoms were managed with prolongation of urethral catheters. 
Those with significant extraperitoneal extravasations were managed by insertion 
of a tube drain (TD). Abdominal exploration was done for extensive BP and all 
intraperitoneal extravasations.
RESULTS: Our study included 1,570 patients, the mean age was 58 ± 11 years and 
86% were males. Bladder perforation was recorded in 10% (n = 158) of the 
patients. The perforation was extraperitoneal in 95%, and in 86%, the 
perforation was associated with no symptoms, mild symptoms, or mild fluid 
extravasation that required only prolongation of the urethral catheter. On the 
other hand, active intervention was required for the 21 remaining patients (14%) 
with TD being the most frequent management. History of previous TURBT 
(p = 0.001) and obturator jerk (p = 0.0001) were the only predictors for BP.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of bladder perforation is 10%; however, 86% 
required only prolongation of urethral catheter. Bladder perforation did not 
affect the probability for tumor recurrence, tumor progression nor radical 
cystectomy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s11255-023-03638-6

annual effective dose was also evaluated for both summer and fortnight tourists. 
The radiological hazard indices for Barra de Valizas inhabitants are higher than 
the worldwide mean and recommended values. This may contribute to Rocha's higher 
SRM value, although a direct correlation cannot be assured with the 
epidemiological information currently available. Social, medical and

arbor-tristis (Nat) flower extract-derived Zinc Ferrite NPs (Nat-ZnFe2O4 NPs) 
were synthesized and physicochemically characterized by FTIR, XRD, FE-SEM, DLS, 
and other instruments to study their crystallinity, size, shape, net charge, 
presence of phytocompounds on NP's surface and several other features. The 
average particle size of Nat-ZnFe2O4 NPs was approx. 25.87 ± 5.67 nm. XRD 
results showed the crystalline nature of Nat-ZnFe2O4 NPs. The net surface charge 
on NPs was -13.28 ± 7.18 mV. When tested on mouse fibroblasts and human RBCs, 
these NPs were biocompatible and hemocompatible. Later, these Nat-ZnFe2O4 NPs 
exhibited potent anti-neoplastic activity against pancreatic, lung, and cervical 
cancer cells. In addition, NPs induced apoptosis in tested cancer cells through 
ROS generation. These in vitro studies confirmed that Nat-ZnFe2O4 NPs could be

and the prognosis of cervical carcinoma tissues. The cervical cancer tissues and 
para-carcinoma tissues of 106 patients with cervical carcinoma surgically 
removed in our hospital were chosen as specimens. LncRNA TDRG1 expression in 
cervical carcinoma tissues and para-carcinoma tissues was inspected by real-time 
fluorescence quantitative PCR, and the correlation between LncRNA TDRG1 and the 
clinicopathological parameters and disease prognosis was analyzed. The relative 
expression of LncRNA TDRG1 in cervical carcinoma tissues was critically gone up 
(P < 0.05) compared to para-carcinoma tissues. The relative expression of LncRNA 
TDRG1 in cervical carcinoma was correlated with FIGO staging, lymph node 
metastasis, infiltrating depth of cervical basal, and the differentiation of 
cancer cells (P < 0.05). According to the results of the Kaplan-Meier curve and 
Log-rank test, the overall survival conditions of subjects with low-lncRNA TDRG1 
were superior to that of those with high-lncRNA TDRG1 expression (P < 0.05). The 
expression of LncRNA TDRG1 in cervical carcinoma tissues and the 
clinicopathological features in predicting the overall survival (OS) in 
sufferers with cervical carcinoma were investigated by the Cox regression model. 
LncRNA TDRG1 expression in cervical carcinoma tissues is tightly associated with 
the progression and prognosis of cervical carcinoma, which may be a latent 
biological indicator for clinical diagnosis and prognosis of cervical carcinoma.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

subjects with CRC cells, and the role of miR451 in colorectal cancer cells. In 
October 2020, ATC purchased CRC and normal mucosal cell lines of CRC and 
implanted them in DMEM with 10% fetal serum. The suitability of the HT29 cell 
line is verified using the STR profile. In an incubator with 5% CO2, enlarged 
cells were placed at 37 °C. TCGA data was used to select the top 120 patients 
with a high voice and the lowest 120 patients with a low voice. Cells were 
collected and coated with Annexin V and PE according to the manufacturer's 
instructions after 24.0 h. After that, the cells were separated. Cells were also 
tested using flow cytometry. HCT-120 cells were transplanted into a 
concentration of 5×105/ml cells in 6-source plates. HCT120 cells in the 
experimental group were combined with miR451 mimics, miR451 inhibitors, or 
miR451 miR + SMAD4B for 12 h at 37 °C, and cells were collected 24 h later at 37 
°C. The sample was injected with 5 ml of Annexin VFITC and PE. Compared with 
normal colorectal mucosal cells, CRC cell lines decreased miR451 expression 
levels (fetal human cells (FHC) and HCoEpiC). Then, the HCT120 cells were 
transfected with miR451 inhibitors, and 72 h after transfection, say of miR451 
was normal. There was a significant decrease in cell function in the miR451mimic 
groups, but an increase when the miR451 was blocked. The proliferation of cancer 
cells was prevented and chemotherapy was effective when miR451 was 
overexpressed. The SMAD4 gene provides instructions for making a protein 
involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. 
The SMAD4B expression was tested by RT-qPCR and Western blotting after 72.0 h of 
transmission. The mRNA and protein expression of SMAD4B decreased significantly 
when miR451 was significantly higher than when inhibited, as revealed in the 
results of this study. Seventy-two hours after transplantation, mRNA levels and 
SMAD4B proteins were measured in HCT120 cells. In addition, the researchers in 
this study investigated whether miR451 was associated with SMAD4B-directed 
control of CRC growth and migration. It was found that SMAD4B is highly 
expressed in both CRC and para-cancer tissues while using the TCGA database to 
detect SMAD4B expression. Patients with CRC with SMAD4B have a severe prognosis. 
MiR451 is sensitive to depressive disorders by targeting SMAD4B, according to 
these studies. We found that miR451 inhibited cell growth and migration, made 
CRC cells more readily available in chemotherapy, and did so by targeting 
SMAD4B. The findings suggest that miR451 and its genetic predisposition, SMAD4B, 
may help predict the prognosis and course of cancer patients. Treatments that 
target the miR451/SMAD4B axis may be helpful to people with CRC.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

a competitive binding to the PSMA receptor. For diagnostic imaging, this could 
impact decision making, while during radioligand therapy this could affect 
treatment efficacy. The relationship between folate dose, timing of dosing and 
tumor and organ uptake is not well established. The aim of this study was to 
develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict the 
effect of folates on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT uptake in salivary glands, kidneys 
and tumors.
METHODS: A PBPK model was developed for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and folates (folic acid 
and its metabolite 5-MTHF), with compartments added that represent salivary 
glands and tumor. Reactions describing receptor binding, internalization and 
intracellular degradation were included. Model evaluation for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 
was performed by using patient scan data from two different studies (static and 
dynamic), while for folates data from the literature were used for evaluation. 
Simulations were performed to assess the effect of different folate doses 
(150 µg, 400 µg, 5 mg and 10 mg) on accumulation in salivary glands, kidney and 
tumor, also for patients with different tumor volumes (10, 100, 500 and 
1000 mL).
RESULTS: Final model evaluation showed that predictions adequately described 
data for both [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and folates. Predictions of a 5-MTFH dose of 
150 µg and folic acid dose of 400 µg (in case of administration at the same time 
as [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (t = 0)) showed no clinically relevant effect on salivary 
glands and kidney uptake. However, the effect of a decrease in salivary glands 
and kidney uptake was determined to be clinically relevant for doses of 5 mg 
(34% decrease for salivary glands and 32% decrease for kidney) and 10 mg (36% 
decrease for salivary glands and 34% decrease for kidney). Predictions showed 
that tumor uptake was not relevantly affected by the co-administration of folate 
for all different folate doses (range 150 µg-10 mg). Lastly, different tumor 
volumes did not impact the folate effect on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 biodistribution.
CONCLUSION: Using a PBPK model approach, high doses of folate (5 and 10 mg) were 
predicted to show a decrease of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 salivary glands and kidney 
uptake, while intake by means of folate containing food or vitamin supplements 
showed no relevant effects. In addition, tumor uptake was not affected by folate 
administration in the simulated dose ranges (150 µg-10 mg). Differences in tumor 
volume are not expected to impact folate effects on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 organ 
uptake.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13550-023-01008-y

(#)Contributed equally","INTRODUCTION: Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumor. 
Recently, various genetic classification systems for meningioma have been 
described. We sought to identify clinical drivers of different molecular changes 
in meningioma. As such, clinical and genomic consequences of smoking in patients 
with meningiomas remain unexplored.
METHODS: 88 tumor samples were analyzed in this study. Whole exome sequencing 
(WES) was used to assess somatic mutation burden. RNA sequencing data was used 
to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) and genes sets (GSEA).
RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients had no history of smoking, twenty-two were past 
smokers, and nine were current smokers. The clinical data showed no major 
differences in natural history across smoking status. WES revealed absence of 
AKT1 mutation rate in current or past smokers compared to non-smokers 
(p = 0.046). Current smokers had increased mutation rate in NOTCH2 compared to 
past and never smokers (p < 0.05). Mutational signature from current and past 
smokers showed disrupted DNA mismatch repair (cosine-similarity = 0.759 and 
0.783). DEG analysis revealed the xenobiotic metabolic genes UGT2A1 and UGT2A2 
were both significantly downregulated in current smokers compared to past 
(Log2FC = - 3.97, padj = 0.0347 and Log2FC = - 4.18, padj = 0.0304) and never 
smokers (Log2FC = - 3.86, padj = 0.0235 and Log2FC = - 4.20, padj = 0.0149). 
GSEA analysis of current smokers showed downregulation of xenobiotic metabolism 
and enrichment for G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, and mitotic spindle compared to 
past and never smokers (FDR < 25% each).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of meningioma 
patients based on their smoking history, examining both their clinical 
trajectories and molecular changes. Meningiomas from current smokers were more 
likely to harbor NOTCH2 mutations, and AKT1 mutations were absent in current or 
past smokers. Moreover, both current and past smokers exhibited a mutational 
signature associated with DNA mismatch repair. Meningiomas from current smokers 
demonstrate downregulation of xenobiotic metabolic enzymes UGT2A1 and UGT2A2, 
which are downregulated in other smoking related cancers. Furthermore, current 
smokers exhibited downregulation xenobiotic metabolic gene sets, as well as 
enrichment in gene sets related to mitotic spindle, E2F targets, and G2M 
checkpoint, which are hallmark pathways involved in cell division and DNA 
replication control. In aggregate, our results demonstrate novel alterations in 
meningioma molecular biology in response to systemic carcinogens.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

proliferation, induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and 
invasion through gain- and loss- of function experiments. In vivo results 
consistently showed that AURKB up-regulation not only promoted tumor growth, but 
also promoted tumor metastasis. Importantly, we discovered that AURKB regulates 
the expressions of EMT-related genes via PI3K/AKT signaling axis. Herein, our 
results suggest that AURKB induced EMT through the activation of PI3K/AKT

target for immunotherapy of cancer. Here, we investigated the correlation 
between POTEE mutation and the clinical outcome of ICIs treatment in non-small

predictive value of POTEE mutation of immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC. The 
prognostic analysis and the potential molecular mechanism exploration were 
conducted based on the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In the 
merged cohort, patients with POTEE-mutation (POTEE-Mut) had a significantly 
higher objective response rate (ORR) (100% vs 27.7%; P < 0.001) and longer 
progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.001; HR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 - 0.54)

with POTEE-Mut showed higher ORR (100% vs 27.2%; P < 0.001) and longer PFS (P = 
0.001; HR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 - 0.52) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). POTEE 
mutation was significantly associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB)

set enrichment analyses (GSEA) analysis revealed prominent enrichment of 
signatures related to DNA repair in POTEE-Mut group (P < 0.001) in LUAD. Our 
results indicate that POTEE mutation could serve as a potential predictive 
biomarker for ICIs in LUAD. However, prospective cohort studies are still needed

(LAGC) who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) was scarcely 
discussed, and never had the factors affecting the prognosis of pCR patients 
been investigated.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients who achieved a pCR to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in Jinling Hospital. The 3- and 5-year overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated with the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Meanwhile, univariate and multivariate COX regression 
analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors affecting patients' 
survival.
RESULTS: A total of 37 consecutive LAGC patients with pCR were included. The 3- 
and 5-year OS rates were 88.8% and 78.6%, and the 3- and 5-year PFS rates were 
86.5% and 75.8%. In the multivariate COX model, NAC duration of more than 3 
cycles (HR 0.11 [0.02-0.62], P = 0.013) and poorly differentiated tumor at 
diagnosis (HR 0.17 [0.03-0.95], P = 0.043) were detected as protective factors 
for patients OS. Whereas for PFS, NAC duration (HR 0.12 [0.02-0.67], P = 0.015) 
was the only protective factor confirmed, with tumor differentiation at 
diagnosis exhibiting marginal significance (HR 0.21 [0.04-1.09], P = 0.063).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LAGC who achieved a pCR displayed favorable long-term 
survival outcome, especially those with adequate cycles (≥ 3) of NAC. Besides, 
poor differentiation at diagnosis might also predict the better OS when pCR 
achieved.","© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Society of Clinical

wound healing, or cancer. It is well known that numerous complex mechanisms are 
involved in cell migration. However, so far it remains poorly understood what 
are the key mechanisms required to produce the main characteristics of this 
behavior. The reason is a methodological one. In experimental studies, specific 
factors and mechanisms can be promoted or inhibited. However, while doing so, 
there can always be others in the background which play key roles but which have 
simply remained unattended so far. This makes it very difficult to validate any 
hypothesis about a minimal set of factors and mechanisms required to produce 
cell migration. To overcome this natural limitation of experimental studies, we 
developed a computational model where cells and extracellular matrix fibers are 
represented by discrete mechanical objects on the micrometer scale. In this 
model, we had exact control of the mechanisms by which cells and matrix fibers 
interacted with each other. This enabled us to identify the key mechanisms 
required to produce physiologically realistic cell migration (including advanced 
phenomena such as durotaxis and a biphasic relation between migration efficiency 
and matrix stiffness). We found that two main mechanisms are required to this 
end: a catch-slip bond of individual integrins and cytoskeletal actin-myosin 
contraction. Notably, more advanced phenomena such as cell polarization or 
details of mechanosensing were not necessary to qualitatively reproduce the main 
characteristics of cell migration observed in experiments.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10237-023-01709-2

their selective oncolytic action against malignancies. Immuno-oncolytic viruses 
are a potential category of anticancer treatments because they have natural 
features that allow viruses to efficiently infect, replicate, and destroy cancer 
cells. Oncolytic viruses may be genetically modified; engineers can use them as 
a platform to develop additional therapy modalities that overcome the 
limitations of current treatment approaches. In recent years, researchers have 
made great strides in the understanding relationship between cancer and the 
immune system. An increasing corpus of research is functioning on the 
immunomodulatory functions of oncolytic virus (OVs). Several clinical studies 
are currently underway to determine the efficacy of these immuno-oncolytic 
viruses. These studies are exploring the design of these platforms to elicit the 
desired immune response and to supplement the available immunotherapeutic 
modalities to render immune-resistant malignancies amenable to treatment. This 
review will discuss current research and clinical developments on Vaxinia

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer initially 
responds to serial courses of endocrine therapy, but ultimately becomes 
refractory. Elacestrant, a new generation FDA-approved oral selective estrogen 
receptor degrader (SERD) and antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in a subset 
of women with advanced HR+breast cancer, but there are few patient-derived 
models to characterize its effect in advanced cancers with diverse treatment 
histories and acquired mutations.
METHODS: We analyzed clinical outcomes with elacestrant, compared with endocrine 
therapy, among women who had previously been treated with a 
fulvestrant-containing regimen from the recent phase 3 EMERALD Study. We further 
modeled sensitivity to elacestrant, compared with the currently approved SERD, 
fulvestrant in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and cultured circulating 
tumor cells (CTCs).
RESULTS: Analysis of the subset of breast cancer patients enrolled in the 
EMERALD study who had previously received a fulvestrant-containing regimen 
indicates that they had better progression-free survival with elacestrant than 
with standard-of-care endocrine therapy, a finding that was independent estrogen 
receptor (ESR1) gene mutations. We modeled elacestrant responsiveness using 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and in ex vivo cultured CTCs derived from 
patients with HR+breast cancer extensively treated with multiple endocrine 
therapies, including fulvestrant. Both CTCs and PDX models are refractory to 
fulvestrant but sensitive to elacestrant, independent of mutations in ESR1 and 
Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA) 
genes.
CONCLUSION: Elacestrant retains efficacy in breast cancer cells that have 
acquired resistance to currently available ER targeting therapies. Elacestrant 
may be an option for patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer whose disease 
progressed on fulvestrant in the metastatic setting.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Serial endocrine therapy is the mainstay of management 
for metastatic HR+breast cancer, but acquisition of drug resistance highlights 
the need for better therapies. Elacestrant is a recently FDA-approved novel oral 
selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), with demonstrated efficacy in the 
EMERALD phase 3 clinical trial of refractory HR+breast cancer. Subgroup analysis 
of the EMERALD clinical trial identifies clinical benefit with elacestrant in 
patients who had received prior fulvestrant independent of the mutational status 
of the ESR1 gene, supporting its potential utility in treating refractory 
HR+breast cancer. Here, we use pre-clinical models, including ex vivo cultures 
of circulating tumor cells and patient-derived xenografts, to demonstrate the 
efficacy of elacestrant in breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to 
fulvestrant.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10549-023-06998-w

Although various strategies against prostate cancer have been developed, only a 
few achieved tumor-specific targeting. Therefore, a special emphasis has been 
placed on the treatment of cancer using nano-carrier-encapsulated 
chemotherapeutic agents conjugated with tumor-homing peptides. The targeting 
strategy coupling the drugs with nanotechnology helps to overcome the most 
common barriers, such as high toxicity and side effects. Prostate-specific 
membrane antigen has emerged as a promising target molecule for prostate cancer 
and shown to be targeted with high affinity by GRFLTGGTGRLLRIS peptide known as 
peptide 563 (P563). Here, we aimed to assess the in vitro and in vivo targeting 
efficiency, safety, and efficacy of P563-conjugated, docetaxel (DTX)-loaded 
polymeric micelle nanoparticles (P563-PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL-DTX) against 
prostate cancer. To this end, we analyzed the cytotoxic activity of 
P563-PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL and P563-PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL-DTX by a cell 
proliferation assay using PNT1A and 22Rv1 cells. We have also determined the 
targeting selectivity of P563-PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL-FITC by flow cytometry and 
assessed the induction of cell death by western blot and TUNEL assays for 
P563-PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL-DTX in 22Rv1 cells. To investigate the in vivo 
efficacy, we administered DTX in the free form or in polymeric micelle 
nanoparticles to athymic CD-1 nu/nu mice 22Rv1 xenograft models and performed 
histopathological analyses. Our study showed that targeting prostate cancer with 
P563-conjugated PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL polymeric micelles could exert a potent 
anti-cancer activity with low side effects.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria,

North Carolinian cancer caregivers at the intersection of cancer and the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: In spring, 2020, we recruited self-identified primary caregivers (CGs) 
for a relative/friend with cancer living in a rural area. We conducted 
cross-sectional semi-structured interviews and then thematically analyzed 
transcripts to identify and categorize instances of stressors and 
benefit-finding.
RESULTS: Of the 24 participants, 29% were < 50 years old, 42% identified as 
non-Hispanic Black, 75% were women, and 58% were spousal CGs. Most care 
recipients (CRs) had stage IV cancer (n = 20) and cancer types varied. 
Participants played a variety of roles in caregiving and experienced stressors 
related to caregiving demands (e.g., conflicts with other responsibilities), 
rurality (e.g., transportation), and the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., new visitor 
policy at hospital). Despite stressful experiences, participants also identified 
many positive aspects of their caregiving. Five domains of benefit-finding were 
identified: appreciation (e.g., gratitude toward their ability to care for CRs), 
CG-CR dyad relationship dynamics (e.g., increased closeness), interpersonal 
relationship dynamics (e.g., perceived peer support), faith (e.g., ability to 
cope through praying), and personal growth (e.g., new skills learned from 
caregiving).
CONCLUSION: Rural-dwelling cancer caregivers from mixed sociodemographic 
backgrounds identified a diverse range of benefits from caregiving, despite 
experiencing multiple stressors, including emergent stressors from the COVID-19 
pandemic. Healthcare delivery serving rural communities may consider expanding 
transportation assistance and boosting benefit-finding to ameliorate stress in 
cancer caregivers.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) after image-guided microwave ablation (MWA) plus 
chemotherapy.
METHODS: Data from a previous multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) was 
used and assigned to either the training data set or the external validation 
data set according to the location of the centers. Potential prognostic factors 
were identified by multivariable analysis in the training data set and used to 
construct a nomogram. After bootstraps internal and external validation, the 
predictive performance was evaluated by concordance index (C-index), Brier 
Score, and calibration curves. Risk group stratification was conducted using the 
score calculated by the nomogram. Then a simplified scoring system was built to 
make risk group stratification more convenient.
RESULTS: In total, 148 patients (training data set: n = 112; external validation 
data set: n = 36) were enrolled for analysis. Six potential predictors were 
identified and entered into the nomogram, including weight loss, histology, 
clinical TNM stage, clinical N category, tumor location, and tumor size. The 
C-indexes were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.88, internal validation) and 0.64 (95% CI, 
0.43-0.85, external validation). The survival curves of different risk groups 
also displayed significant distinction (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: We found weight loss, histology, clinical TNM stage, clinical N 
category, tumor location, and tumor size were prognostic factors of progression 
after receiving MWA plus chemotherapy and constructed a prediction model that 
can predict PFS.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The nomogram and scoring system will assist 
physicians to predict the individualized PFS of their patients and decide 
whether to perform or terminate MWA and chemotherapy according to the expected 
benefits.
KEY POINTS: • Build and validate a prognostic model using the data from a 
previous randomized controlled trial to predict progression-free survival after 
receiving MWA plus chemotherapy. • Weight loss, histology, clinical TNM stage,

breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NAC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 
2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center 
study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema 
score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression 
analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to 
residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on 
a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining 
cases.
RESULTS: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n = 7/37, 19%), 
triple negative (n = 30/55, 55%), HER2 + (n = 22/37, 59%)). Clinical and 
biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p < 0.001), T stage 0/I/II 
(p = 0.008), higher Ki67 (p = 0.005), and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
levels (p = 0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, 
oval or round shape (p = 0.047), unifocality (p = 0.026), non-spiculated margins 
(p = 0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (p = 0.024), and a lower MRI 
size (p = 0.031), were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and 
non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at 
multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological 
variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 
versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67), and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) 
for pCR prediction.
CONCLUSION: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated 
with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI 
features with clinicobiological predictors, including tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, could be employed to develop machine learning models for 
identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of 
alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes.
KEY POINTS: • Unifocality and non-spiculated margins are independently 
associated with pCR at multivariable logistic regression analysis. • Breast 
edema score is associated with MR tumor size and TIL expression, not only in TN 
BC as previously reported, but also in luminal BC. • Adding significant MRI 
features to clinicobiological variables in machine learning classifiers 
significantly increased sensitivity, specificity, and precision for pCR 
prediction.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.","DOI: 10.1007/s00330-023-09797-5

involving a coordinated effort between cell migration and matrix degradation, 
and has been the subject of mathematical modelling for almost 30 years. In this 
current paper we address a long-standing question in the field of cancer cell 
migration modelling. Namely, identify the migratory pattern and spread of 
individual cancer cells, or small clusters of cancer cells, when the macroscopic 
evolution of the cancer cell colony is dictated by a specific partial 
differential equation (PDE). We show that the usual heuristic understanding of 
the diffusion and advection terms of the PDE being one-to-one responsible for 
the random and biased motion of the solitary cancer cells, respectively, is not 
precise. On the contrary, we show that the drift term of the correct stochastic

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate whether short course of neoadjuvant 
denosumab treatment for spinal GCTB could (1) Induce radiological and 
histological response? (2) Facilitate en bloc resection? (3) Achieve 
satisfactory oncological and functional outcomes?
METHODS: The clinical information of ten consecutive patients between 2018 and 
2022 with spinal GCTB treated with short course of neoadjuvant denosumab (≤ 5 
doses) and en bloc spondylectomy was retrospectively reviewed. The radiological 
and histological response, operative data, oncological and functional outcomes 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean doses of neoadjuvant denosumab were 4.2 (range 3-5 doses). 
After neoadjuvant denosumab, there were 9 cases showing new ossification and 5 
cases with reappearance of cortical integrity. The values of Hounsfield units 
(HU) of the soft tissue component were increased by > 50% in 7 cases. The signal 
intensity (SI) ratios of tumor/muscle in T2WI of plain MRI were decreased 
by > 10% in 60% of the cases. Shrinkage of soft tissue mass by > 10% was 
observed in 4 cases. The mean duration of operation was 575 ± 174 min, and the 
mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 2790 ± 1934 ml. No obvious adhesion to dura 
mater or major vessels was encounter intraoperatively. There is no tumor 
collapse or breakage during surgery. Multinucleated giant cells were decreased 
in 6 cases (60%) with the remaining 4 cases showing absence of multinucleated 
giant cells. Mononuclear stromal cells existed in most of the cases (8 cases, 
80%). New bone formation was noticed in 8 cases (80%). No patient had a 
worsening of neurologic function after surgery. No tumor recurrence was noticed 
within the mean follow-up of 24 ± 20 months.
CONCLUSION: Short-term neoadjuvant denosumab could yield radiological and 
histological responses and might facilitate en bloc spondylectomy by hardening 
the tumor and causing less adhesion to segmental vessels, major vessels and 
nerve roots, which was beneficial to achieve the optimal oncological and 
functional outcomes.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00586-023-07770-w

colorectal cancer (CRC) using bioinformatics.
METHODS: GSE39582 and GSE39084, which collectively contain 363 CRC samples, were 
downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as a test set. 
TCGA-COADREAD, with 376 CRC samples, was downloaded from the UCSC database as a 
validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for ARGs 
that were significantly associated with prognosis. The top 10 ARGs were used to 
classify the samples into different subtypes based on unsupervised cluster 
analysis. The immune environments of the different subtypes were analyzed. ARGs 
that were significantly associated with CRC prognosis were used to construct a 
risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to 
screen independent prognostic factors and construct a nomogram.
RESULTS: Four anoikis-related subtypes (ARSs) with differential prognoses and 
immune microenvironments were identified. KRAS and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition pathways were enriched in subtype B, which had the worst prognosis. 
Three ARGs (DLG1, AKT3, and LPAR1) were used to construct the risk model. Both 
the test and validation sets showed worse outcomes for patients in the high-risk 
group than those in the low-risk group. Risk score was found to be an 
independent prognostic factor for CRC. Moreover, there was a difference in drug 
sensitivity between the high- and low-risk groups.
CONCLUSION: The identified ARGs and risk scores were associated with CRC 
prognosis and could predict the responses of patients with CRC to immunotherapy 
strategies.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

studied as a potential biomarker in a variety of cancers, but poorly studied in 
gastric cancer (GC). The purpose of this study was to explore the prognostic 
value of SERPINE1 in GC and primarily analyze its functions.
METHODS: We analyzed the the prognostic value of SERPINE1 and studied the 
relationship with clinicopathologic biomarkers in gastric cancer. The expression 
of SERPINE1 was analyzed by GEO and TCGA databases. Moreover, we validated the 
results by immunohistochemistry. Next, the correlation analysis between SERPINE1 
and the cuproptosis-related genes was analyzed by the ""Spearman"" method. 
CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithms were used to analyze the correlation of SERPINE1 
with immune infiltration. Furthermore, GO and KEGG gene enrichment analyses were 
used to study the functions and pathways that SERPINE1 might be involved in. 
Then, drug sensitivity analysis was performed using CellMiner database. Finally, 
a cuproptosis-immune-related prognostic model was constructed using genes 
related to immune and cuproptosis, and verified against external datasets.
RESULTS: SERPINE1 was up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues, which tends toward 
poor prognosis. Using immunohistochemistry experiment, the expression and 
prognostic value of SERPINE1 were verified. Then, we found that SERPINE1 was 
negatively correlated with cuproptosis-related genes FDX1, LIAS, LIPT1, and 
PDHA1. On the contrary, SERPINE1 was positively correlated with APOE. This 
indicates the effect of SERPINE1 on the cuproptosis process. Furthermore, by 
conducting immune-related analyses, it was revealed that SERPINE1 may promote 
the inhibitory immune microenvironment. The infiltration level of resting NK 
cells, neutrophils, activated mast cells, and macrophages M2 was positively 
correlated with SERPINE1. However, B cell memory and plasma cells were 
negatively correlated with SERPINE1. Functional analysis showed that SERPINE1 
was closely related to angiogenesis, apoptosis, and ECM degradation. The KEGG 
pathway analysis showed that SERPINE1 may be associated with P53, Pi3k/Akt, 
TGF-β, and other signaling pathways. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that 
SERPINE1 could be also seen as a potential treatment target. The risk model 
based on SERPINE1 co-expression genes could better predict the survival of GC 
patients than SERPINE1 alone. We also verified the prognostic value of the risk 
score by GEO external datasets.
CONCLUSION: SERPINE1 is highly expressed in gastric cancer and related to poor 
prognosis. SERPINE1 may regulate cuproptosis and the immune microenvironment by 
a series of pathways. Therefore, SERPINE1 as a prognostic biomarker and 
potential therapeutic target deserves further study.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00432-023-04900-1

matricellular glycoprotein whose expression is elevated in various types of 
cancer and which has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis 
in many malignancies. Its role in neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) remains to be 
established. The aim of the study was to analyze plasma concentrations of OPN in 
patients with NEN and to explore its diagnostic and prognostic value as a 
clinical biomarker.
METHODS: OPN plasma concentrations were measured in a total of 38 patients with 
histologically proven NEN at three different time points during the course of 
disease and therapy (at the start of the study, after 3 and 12 months, 
respectively) as well as in healthy controls. Clinical and imaging data as well 
as concentrations of Chromogranin A (CgA) and Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) were 
assessed.
RESULTS: OPN levels were significantly higher in patients with NEN compared to 
healthy controls. High-grade tumors (grade 3) showed the highest OPN levels. OPN 
levels were neither different between male and female patients nor between 
different primary tumor sites. OPN correlated significantly with corresponding 
NSE levels, while there was no correlation with Chromogranin A. High OPN levels 
above a cutoff value of 200 ng/ml at initial analysis predicted a worsened 
prognosis with significantly shorter progression-free survival of patients with 
NEN, which also held true within the subgroup of well-differentiated G1/G2 
tumors.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that high baseline OPN levels in patients with NEN 
are predictive of an adverse outcome with shorter progression-free survival, 
even within the group of well differentiated G1/G2 tumors. Therefore, OPN may be 
used as a surrogate prognostic biomarker in patients with NEN.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00432-023-04979-6

are unsatisfactory, and the disease recurs despite the use of numerous 
medications and their combinations. Trifluridine/Tipiracil is a relatively new 
drug used in refractory mCRC. Little is known about its real-world effectiveness 
and prognostic and predictive factors. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a 
prognostic model for refractory mCRC treated with Trifluridine/Tipiracil.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data from 163 patients who had 
received Trifluridine/Tipiracil as a third or fourth line of treatment for 
refractory mCRC.
RESULTS: After starting Trifluridine/Tipiracil, 21.5% of patients survived one 
year, and the median overall survival after Trifluridine/Tipiracil initiation 
was 251 days (SD: 17.855; 95%CI: 216-286). Median progression-free survival 
after Trifluridine/Tipiracil initiation was 56 days (SD: 4.826; 95%CI 47-65). 
Moreover, the median overall survival from diagnosis was 1333 days (SD: 82.84; 
95%CI: 1170-1495). In forward stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis, 
initial radical treatment (HR = 0.552, 95% CI 0.372-0.819, p < 0.003), the 
number of cycles of first-line chemotherapy (HR = 0.978, 95% CI 0.961-0.995, 
p < 0.011), the number of cycles of second-line chemotherapy (HR = 0.955, 95% CI 
0.931-0.98, p < 0.011), BRAF mutation (HR = 3.016, 95% CI = 1.207-7.537, 
p = 0.018), and hypertension (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44-0.931, p = 0.02) were all

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of a novel 
immune and nutritional score combining prognostic values of the controlling 
nutritional status (CONUT) score and prognostic immune and nutritional index 
(PINI) on long-term outcomes in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma 
(UTUC) after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU).
METHODS: This study analyzed 437 consecutive patients with UTUC treated by RNU. 
Restricted cubic splines were used to visualize the relation of PINI with 
Survival in patients with UTUC. The PINI was stratified into low- (1) and 
high-PINI (0) categories. The CONUT score was divided into three groups: Normal 
(1), Light (2), and Moderate/severe (3). Subsequently, patients were grouped 
according to CONUT-PINI score (CPS) (CPS group 1; CPS group 2; CPS group 3; and 
CPS group 4). Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to 
determine the risk factors associated with overall Survival (OS) and 
cancer-specific Survival (CSS). By comprising independent prognostic factors, a 
predictive nomogram was constructed.
RESULTS: PINI and CONUT score were identified as independent prognostic factors 
for OS and CSS. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high CPS group 
was associated with worse OS and CSS than the low CPS group. Multivariate Cox 
regression and competing risk analyses showed that CPS, LVI, T stage, margin, 
and pN were independent factors associated with OS and CSS. Based on these five 
significant factors, we constructed a prognostic model for predicting clinical 
outcomes. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the model 
had excellent predictive abilities for survival. The C-index of this model for 
OS and CSS were 0.773, and 0.789, respectively. The nomogram for OS and CSS 
showed good discrimination and calibration. Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed 
that this nomogram has a higher net benefit.
CONCLUSION: The CPS combined the prognostic capacity of PINI and CONUT score and 
was able to predict patient outcomes in our cohort of UTUC patients. We have 
developed a nomogram to facilitate the clinical use of the CPS and provide 
accurate estimates of survival for individuals.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

urothelial carcinoma (BUC) before radical cystectomy aids clinical decision 
making. Here, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to preoperatively 
predict LNM in BUC patients.
METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed BUC, who underwent radical 
cystectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy, were retrospectively recruited from 
two institutions. Patients from one institution were enrolled in the primary 
cohort, while those from the other were enrolled in the external validation 
cohort. Patient demographic, pathological (using transurethral resection of the 
bladder tumor specimens), imaging, and laboratory data were recorded. Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the 
independent preoperative risk factors and develop the nomogram. Internal and 
external validation was conducted to assess nomogram performance.
RESULTS: 522 and 215 BUC patients were enrolled in the primary and external 
validation cohorts, respectively. We identified tumor grade, infiltration, 
extravesical invasion, LNM on imaging, tumor size, and serum creatinine levels 
as independent preoperative risk factors, which were subsequently used to 
develop the nomogram. The nomogram showed a good predictive accuracy, with area 
under the receiver operator characteristic curve values of 0.817 and 0.825 for

life (HRQoL) in survivors of childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumours.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from the National Children's Cancer Service 
in Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis 
of a primary CNS tumour, aged between 6 and 17 years, between 3 months and 
5 years post completion of oncology treatment, independently mobile, and deemed 
clinically appropriate to participate by treating oncologist. Cardiorespiratory 
fitness was assessed using the six-minute walk test. HRQoL was assessed with the 
PedsQL Generic Core Scales, Version 4.0.
RESULTS: Thirty-four participants (n = 16 male) were recruited, with a mean age 
of 12.21 ± 3.31 years and a mean time since completion of oncology treatment of 
2.19 ± 1.29 years. Mean six-minute walk distance (6MWD) achieved was 
489.56 ± 61.48 m, equating to the 8th percentile overall. 6MWD was significantly 
reduced when compared to predicted population norms (p < 0.001). PedsQL parent 
proxy-report and child-report scores were significantly lower when compared to 
healthy paediatric norms (p < 0.001 - p = 0.011). A significant positive 
correlation was found between 6MWD and both parent proxy-report (r = 0.55,

CONCLUSION: Survivors of childhood CNS tumours present with impaired 
cardiorespiratory fitness and HRQoL. Higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness 
are associated with higher levels of HRQoL.

OBJECTIVES: What are new or emerging developments in radioligand therapy for 
prostate cancer?
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the current literature was performed.
RESULTS: The further development of radioligand therapy for prostate cancer is 
currently taking place primarily in the following areas: application in earlier 
stages of the disease, use of alternative isotopes, development and use of new 
ligands, search for new target structures and combination with other forms of 
therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Radioligand therapy has become an integral part of the therapy 
algorithm in the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Application in earlier stages of the disease is foreseeable. In the future, new

FRAGESTELLUNG: Welche neuen Entwicklungen der RLT des Prostatakarzinoms gibt es 
bzw. zeichnen sich ab?
MATERIAL UND METHODEN: Es handelt sich um einen Übersichtsartikel mit aktueller 
Literaturrecherche.
ERGEBNISSE: Die Weiterentwicklung der RLT des Prostatakarzinoms findet 
gegenwärtig in erster Linie in folgenden Bereichen statt: Anwendung in früheren 
Krankheitsstadien, Verwendung alternativer Isotope, Entwicklung und Verwendung 
neuer Liganden, Suche nach neuen Zielstrukturen und Kombination mit anderen 
Therapieformen.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN: Die RLT ist heute bei der Behandlung des mCRPC aus dem 
Therapiealgorithmus nicht mehr wegzudenken. Eine Anwendung in früheren 
Krankheitsstadien ist absehbar. Möglicherweise kann in Zukunft mit Hilfe neuer 
Liganden, alternativer Isotope, neuer Zielstrukturen oder im Rahmen von 
Kombinationstherapien die Wirksamkeit gesteigert und die Toxizität verringert 
werden.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH,

health effects, including gastrointestinal disorders. Preclinical studies 
suggest that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), found in 
Mediterranean foods like nuts and fish, improve intestinal barrier integrity. 
Here, we assessed possible effects of n-3 PUFAs on barrier integrity in a 
randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: We studied 68 women from the open-label LIBRE trial 
(clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02087592) who followed either a Mediterranean diet 
(intervention group, IG) or a standard diet (control group, CG). Study visits 
comprised baseline, month 3, and month 12. Barrier integrity was assessed by 
plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and fecal zonulin; fatty acids 
by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Median and interquartile ranges 
are shown.
RESULTS: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased the proportion of the n-3 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (IG + 1.5% [0.9;2.5, p < 0.001]/ + 0.3% [- 0.1;0.9, 
p < 0.050] after 3/12 months; CG + 0.9% [0.5;1.6, p < 0.001]/ ± 0%) and 
decreased plasma LBP (IG - 0.3 µg/ml [- 0.6;0.1, p < 0.010]/ - 0.3 µg/ml 
[- 1.1; - 0.1, p < 0.001]; CG - 0.2 µg/ml [- 0.8; - 0.1, p < 0.001]/ ± 0 µg/ml) 
and fecal zonulin levels (IG - 76 ng/mg [- 164; - 12, p < 0.010]/ - 74 ng/mg 
[- 197;15, p < 0.001]; CG - 59 ng/mg [- 186;15, p < 0.050]/ + 10 ng/mg 
[- 117;24, p > 0.050]). Plasma DHA and LBP (R2: 0.14-0.42; all p < 0.070), as 
well as plasma DHA and fecal zonulin (R2: 0.18-0.48; all p < 0.050) were found 
to be inversely associated in bi- and multivariate analyses. Further 
multivariate analyses showed that the effect of DHA on barrier integrity was 
less pronounced than the effect of fecal short-chain fatty acids on barrier 
integrity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that n-3 PUFAs can improve intestinal barrier 
integrity.

decades as a complication of posterior fossa tumour surgery in children. Risk 
factors, aetiological aspects, and treatment measures of the syndrome have been 
investigated, yet the incidence of CMS remains unchanged. Overall, we are 
currently able to identify patients at risk, but we are unable to prevent it 
from occurring.Once CMS sets in, several symptomatic pharmacological treatments 
have been suggested, but only in smaller case series and not in randomized 
controlled trials, and it is not clear whether the treatment or time itself had 
a helpful effect.Within weeks to months, most patients regain their ability to 
speak after a phase with mutism or severely reduced speech; however, many 
patients continue to have speech and language deficits. At this point, 
anti-cancer treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be of focus more 
than the prognosis of CMS; however, many patients continue to have speech and 
language problems for months and years to come, and they are at high risk of 
other neurocognitive sequelae as well.Without reliable measures to prevent or 
treat the syndrome, we may look towards improving the prognosis of speech and 
neurocognitive functioning in these patients. As speech and language impairment 
is the cardinal symptom and late effect of CMS, the effect of intense and 
early-onset speech and language therapy as a standard of care in these patients 
should be investigated in relation to its effect on regaining speech capacity.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland

are the second most common type of pediatric cancer after leukemias. As the more 
common solid tumor in neonates and infants, they present some peculiarities such 
as the high incidence of malignancies. Routine ultrasonography made easier to 
detect intrauterine tumors, but diagnosis can be delayed due to the lack or 
scarcity of recognizable symptoms. These neoplasms are often very large and 
highly vascular. Their removal is challenging, and there is a higher rate of 
morbidity and mortality than seen in older children, adolescents, and adults. 
They also differ from older children with respect to location, histological 
features, clinical behavior, and management. Pediatric low-grade gliomas 
represent 30% of the tumors in this age group and comprise circumscribed and 
diffuse tumors. They are followed by medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Other 
non-medulloblastoma embryonal neoplasms, former known as PNETS, are also 
commonly diagnosed in neonates and infants. Teratomas have an expressive 
incidence in newborns but decline gradually until the end of the first year of 
life. Immunohistochemical, molecular, and genomic advances are impacting the 
understanding and targeting of the treatment of some tumors, but, despite all 
these advances, the extent of resection remains the most important factor in the 
prognosis and survival of almost all types of tumors. The outcome is difficult 
to estimate, and 5-year survival ranges from one-quarter to three-quarters of 
the patients.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Fibroblast activation protein is one of the most attractive targets for 
tumor diagnosis and therapy. There have been many successful clinical 
translations with small molecules and peptides, yet only a few anti-FAP antibody 
diagnostic or therapeutic agents have been reported. Antibodies often feature 
good tumor selectivity and long tumor retention, which may be a better-match 
with therapeutic radionuclides (e.g.,177Lu, 225Ac) for cancer therapy. Here we 
report a 177Lu-labeled anti-FAP antibody, PKU525, as a therapeutic 
radiopharmaceutical for FAP-targeted radiotherapy.
METHODS: The anti-FAP antibody is produced as a derivative of sibrotuzumab. The 
pharmacokinetics and blocking study are performed with 89Zr-labeled antibody by 
PET imaging. The conjugation strategies have been screened and tested with SPECT 
imaging through 177Lu-labeling. The biodistribution and radiotherapy studies are 
performed on 177Lu-labeled anti-FAP antibody in NU/NU mice-bearing HT-1080-FAP 
tumors.
RESULTS: A multiple time-point PET imaging study shows that the tumor 
accumulation of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-PKU525 is intense, selective, and relatively rapid. 
The time activity curve indicates that the tumor uptake continually increases 
until reaches the highest uptake (SUVmax = 18.4 ± 2.3, n = 4) at 192 h, then 
gradually declines. Radioactivity rapidly cleared from the blood, liver, and 
other major organs, resulting in high tumor-to-background ratios. An in vivo 
blocking experiment suggests that [89Zr]Zr-DFO-PKU525 is FAP-specific and the 
uptake in FAP-negative tumors is almost negligible. Ex vivo biodistribution 
study shows that the tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-NCS-PKU525 is 23.04 ± 5.11% 
ID/g, 33.2 ± 6.36% ID/g, 19.87 ± 6.84% ID/g and 19.02 ± 5.90% ID/g at 24 h, 
96 h, 168 h, and 240 h after injection (n = 5), which is corroborated with the 
PET imaging. In therapeutic assays, multiple doses of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-NCS-PKU525 
have been tested in tumor-bearing mice, and the data suggests that 3.7 MBq may 
be sufficient to completely suppress the tumor growth in mice without showing 
observable side effects.
CONCLUSION: A FAP-targeted antibody-radionuclide conjugate was developed and 
evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Its tumor accumulation is rapid and high with a 
clean background. It remarkably suppresses the tumors in mice while the side 
effect is almost negligible, showing that it is promising for further clinical 
translational studies.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Ferroptosis is a form of cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid 
peroxidation. Intriguingly, KRAS-mutant cancers are particularly vulnerable to 
ferroptosis. Osthole is a natural coumarin extracted from Cnidium spp. and other 
Apiaceous plants. In the present study, we explored the antitumor potential of 
osthole in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
METHODS: Cell viability assay, EdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry, tumor 
xenograft model, western blot, immunochemistry staining, immunofluorescence, 
transcriptome RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR were 
performed to evaluate the influence of osthole treatment on KRAS-mutant CRC 
cells.
RESULTS: We found that osthole treatment suppressed proliferation and tumor 
growth of KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines HCT116 and SW480. Moreover, osthole 
treatment increased ROS production and induced ferroptosis. Osthole treatment 
also promoted autophagy, but inhibition of autophagy by ATG7 knockdown or 3-MA 
showed no influence on osthole-induced ferroptosis. In comparison, osthole 
increased lysosomal activation, and co-treatment with lysosome inhibitor Baf-A1 
attenuated osthole-induced ferroptosis. Besides, osthole treatment reduced the 
phosphorylation of AMPK, Akt and mTOR in HCT116 and SW480 cells, while restored 
AMPK signaling by AMPK agonist AICAR partially abrogated ferroptosis induced by 
osthole treatment. Finally, co-treatment with osthole increased the cytotoxicity 
of cetuximab in KRAS-mutant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the natural product osthole exerted its 
anticancer effects in KRAS-mutant CRC cells via inducing ferroptosis, and this 
was partially through inhibiting AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling. Our results may expand 
our current knowledge for the use of osthole as an anticancer agent.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, whereas its role in tumor immunity is 
unclear. In this study, it was demonstrated that IL-36α could activate the NF-κB 
and MAPK signaling pathways in macrophages, leading to the expression of IL-1β, 
IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5 and iNOS. Importantly, IL-36α has 
significant antitumor effects, altering the tumor microenvironment and promoting 
the infiltration of MHC IIhigh macrophages and CD8+ T cells while decreasing the 
levels of monocyte myeloid-derived suppressor cells, CD4+ T cells and regulatory 
T cells. This ultimately results in the inhibition of tumor growth and 
migration. Furthermore, IL-36α synergized with the PD-L1 antibody increased the 
immune cells infiltration and enhanced the anti-tumor effect of the PD-L1 
antibody on melanoma. Collectively, this study reveals a new role for IL-36α in

patients. Lockdown measures during COVID-19 pandemic reduced facilities for 
premenopausal patients, impairing oncological and reproductive health. To reduce 
its effect, a telehealth program called insenoallasalute.it was designed in 
Italy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A national-based multicentric observational study was 
undertaken by insenoallasalute.it study group (Italian Ministry of Health, 
Modena Hospital and Tor Vergata University Hospital) to raise awareness among 
women on a) BC and its negative role on reproductive health; b) increase 
adherence to screening programs and self-examination; c) present oncofertility 
strategies. A web-based platform with two sections was designed: an informative 
section and a telehealth application activated with a mobile one-time password. 
After a self-evaluation test to select premenopausal women with maternal desire 
and family or personal history for BC or ovarian cancer, and premenopausal women 
with maternity desires with prior medically assisted procreation, a dedicated 
agenda for telehealth evaluation was displayed and planned. In case the patients 
fulfilled the criteria for further evaluation, they were invited to perform an 
outpatient evaluation in one of the pilot centers.
RESULTS: From July 2021 to December 2021, 2,830 single accounts were activated, 
and 2,450 (86.57%) completed the tests. 53 patients were selected to undergo 
telehealth consultation and 40 (80.0%) scheduled the telehealth visit. 6 
patients underwent surgery in the study centers.

crucial role in the cell cycle, palbociclib and ribociclib are two novel drugs 
that are recently being used in the treatment of breast cancer. Despite 
targeting the same pathway, these agents have different molecular activities and 
processes. KI-67 is known to play a significant role in cell proliferation that 
has been related to prognosis. This study investigated the impact of 
palbociclib, ribociclib, and KI-67 on toxicity and survival in breast cancer 
treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 140 breast cancer patients in total. 
Patients were divided into groups based on the use of different CDK inhibitors 
and KI-67 values. Mortality, progression, treatment response rates, frequency, 
and severity of adverse events were assessed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The patients in our study had an average age of 53.62±12.71 years, and 
62.9% of them were diagnosed at an early stage. 34.3% (n=48) of the patients 
progressed after receiving treatment, while 19.3% (n=27) of the patients died. 
The median follow-up time was 576 days, the maximum follow-up time was 1,471 
days, and the median time to progression was 301 days (min=28-max=713). 
Mortality, progression, and treatment response rate between two different CDK 
inhibitors or KI-67 groups revealed no statistically significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a comparison between the effectiveness of palbociclib 
and ribociclib, and no noticeable difference is found in breast cancer patients' 
survival, progression, or severity of adverse effects. Likewise, there is no 
meaningful difference in KI-67 expression subgroups between progression and

Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. anuryldrm@gmail.com.","OBJECTIVE: Desmoid tumor is a rare benign but locally aggressive monoclonal and 
fibroblastic proliferation. It lacks metastatic potential but is associated with 
a high local recurrence after surgery. It is either characterized by the 
Beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) or the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) 
mutation. The most appropriate treatment approach is watchful waiting with 
periodic follow-ups for asymptomatic patients. However, symptomatic patients who 
are not good candidates for surgery due to high morbidity risk may benefit from 
medical therapy. The new drugs targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) 
and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) display promising results in many cancer 
types. This study assessed the PD-L1 status of desmoid tumors in 18 patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsy and resection materials of 18 patients diagnosed 
with desmoid tumors between April 2016 and April 2021 were retrieved and 
assessed for PD-L1 expression. The prepared slides were immunohistochemically 
stained with PD-L1 antibody using Leica Bond® automated immunohistochemistry 
stainer.
RESULTS: No positive PD-L1 staining of the desmoid tumor cells was detected in 
any specimens. Intratumoral lymphocytes were present in all specimens. However, 
five of them were positively stained for PD-L1.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our study, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy may not

gastric cancer (GC) requires additional para-aortic nodes dissection (PAND). The 
purpose of this study is to summarize current evidence on the potential benefits 
of the extended systemic lymphadenectomy (D2+) compared to D2 lymphadenectomy in 
the treatment of gastric cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed across PubMed, 
Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, VIP Database for 
Chinese Technical Periodicals, and China Biology Medicine disc using the 
following terms: gastric cancer, para-aortic lymphadenectomy, D2+ 
lymphadenectomy and D3 lymphadenectomy. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the 
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies involving 5,643 patients were included, 
consisting of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 14 non-randomized 
controlled trials (nRCT). Compared with the D2 group, the operating time in the 
D2+ group was longer [mean difference (MD)=99.45 min, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) (48.93, 149.97), p<0.001], with more intra-operative blood loss [MD=262.14 
mL, 95% CI (165.21, 359.07), p<0.001]. There were no significant differences in 
five-year overall survival (OS) [HR=1.09, 95% CI (0.95, 1.25), p=0.22] and 
post-operative mortality [RR=0.96, 95% CI (0.59, 1.57), p=0.88] between the two 
groups. The rate of post-operative complications in group D2+ was higher than 
that in group D2 [RR=1.42, 95% CI (1.11, 1.81), p<0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic D2+ surgery is not recommended, since D2+ surgery is 
associated with an increased rate of post-operative complications and does not 
improve the long-term survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer. 
However, D2+ surgery (especially D2+PAND) has certain survival advantages for 
specific patients, and D2+PAND surgery combined with chemotherapy may 
potentially improve long-term survival rate.","DOI: 10.26355/eurrev_202306_32639

New Valley, Egypt. mariansobhy31@yahoo.com.","OBJECTIVE: Some studies have shown that metformin inhibits the proliferation of 
breast cancer (BC) cells via multiple ways. One of these mechanisms is through 
the indirect control of the IGF-route mediated via the activation of the 
AMPK-LKB1 pathway in the liver, which leads to a decrease in blood glucose and 
insulin levels. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 
metformin as adjuvant to chemotherapy on IGF levels in female patients with 
progressive and non-progressive metastatic BC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this trial, 107 women receiving chemotherapy for 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were divided into two groups: the metformin group 
received 500 mg of metformin twice daily, whereas the control group did not 
receive any metformin. All patients received chemotherapy according to the South 
Egypt Cancer Institute's (SECI) established regimen. The level of IGF-1 was 
determined in the blood at the initiation of therapy (baseline) and at six 
months post treatment.
RESULTS: No substantial differences were noted regarding IGF-1 levels in both 
groups at baseline (IGF-1 average level was 40.74 ± 36.16 vs. 32.06 ± 20.00 in 
the metformin and the placebo group, respectively, p = 0.462). While after six 
months, the mean IGF-1 level was 37.62 ± 31.35 vs. 39.12 ± 2 5.93 in the 
metformin and placebo groups, respectively, (p = 0.170).
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin as an adjuvant to chemotherapy in MBC patients had no 
significant effect on reducing IGF-l levels which promotes the inhibition of the 
proliferation of BC cells in MBC patients.","DOI: 10.26355/eurrev_202306_32638

conducted.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis found no significant association between the RAD51 
polymorphism and CRC risk (all p>0.05). PCR-RFLP method detected three kinds of 
genotypes (GG, GC, and CC) in both the colorectal cancer group and the control 
group. A significant association was only found in GC genotype (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that RAD51 polymorphism has a crucial role 
in colorectal cancer risk and that GC genotype confers an increased risk of

pain, intrathecal drug delivery using an intrathecal drug delivery system (IDDS) 
offers effective pain control. In this study, we evaluate the trends of IDDS 
therapy among patients with cancer, associated comorbidities, complications, and 
outcomes, using a large representative US administrative inpatient data base.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data base contains 
data from 48 states and the District of Columbia. The NIS was used to identify 
patients with cancer who underwent IDDS implantation between 2016 and 2019. 
Patients with cancer with intrathecal pumps for the treatment of chronic pain 
were identified using administrative codes. Baseline demographics, hospital 
characteristics, type of cancer associated with IDDS implantation, palliative 
care encounters, hospitalization costs, length of stay, and prevalence of bone 
pain were evaluated in the study.
RESULTS: A total of 22,895 (0.32%) individuals with hospital admission for IDDS 
surgery were included for analysis among 7.06 million individuals with cancer in 
the final cohort. The IDDS cohort consisted of patients predominantly in the 
65-to-79 years age group (40.49%), female sex (50.42%), and Caucasian ethnicity 
(75.82%). The top five cancers in patients receiving IDDS were lung (27.15%), 
colorectal (24.9%), liver (16.44%), bone (8.01%), and liver (7.99%) cancer. In 
addition, the length of stay was six days (interquartile range [IQR] four-nine 
days) and the median cost of hospital admission was $29,062 (IQR 
$19,413-$42,261) in the patients who received an IDDS. These factors were 
greater than those in patients without IDDS.
CONCLUSIONS: A very few patients with cancer received IDDS in the US during the 
study period. Despite recommendations supporting its use, there are significant 
racial and socioeconomic disparities in IDDS use.","Copyright © 2023 International Neuromodulation Society. Published by Elsevier

nervous system and predisposes patients to develop benign and malignant tumors. 
Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are NF1-associated benign tumors that affect 
nearly 100% of patients with NF1. cNFs dramatically reduce patients' QOL owing 
to their unaesthetic appearance, physical discomfort, and corresponding 
psychological burden. There is currently no effective drug therapy option, and 
treatment is restricted to surgical removal. One of the greatest hurdles for cNF 
management is the variability of clinical expressivity in NF1, resulting in 
intrapatient and interpatient cNF tumor burden heterogeneity, that is, the 
variability in the presentation and evolution of these tumors. There is growing 
evidence that a wide array of factors are involved in the regulation of cNF 
heterogeneity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity of cNF

progenitor cells (HPCs) are crucial for engraftment. Additional-day apheresis 
collections can compensate for potential loss during cryopreservation but incur 
high cost and additional risk. To aid predicting such losses for clinical 
decision support, we developed a machine-learning model using variables 
obtainable on the day of collection.
METHODS: In total, 370 consecutive autologous HPCs, apheresis-collected since 
2014 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, were retrospectively reviewed. 
Flow cytometry was used to assess vCD34% on fresh products and thawed quality 
control vials. The ratio of vCD34% thawed to fresh, which we call ""post-thaw 
index,"" was used as an outcome measure, with a ""poor"" post-thaw index defined as 
<70%. HPC CD45 normalized mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated by 
dividing CD45 MFI of HPCs to the CD45 MFI of lymphocytes in the same sample. We 
trained XGBoost, k-nearest neighbor and random forest models for the prediction 
and calibrated the best model to minimize falsely-reassuring predictions.
RESULTS: In total, 63 of 370 (17%) products had a poor post-thaw index. The best 
model was XGBoost, with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.83 
evaluated on an independent test data set. The most important predictor for a 
poor post-thaw index was the HPC CD45 normalized MFI. Transplants after 2015, 
based on the lower of the two vCD34% values, showed faster engraftment than 
older transplants, which were based on fresh vCD34% only (average 10.6 vs 11.7 
days, P = 0.0006).
CONCLUSIONS: Transplants taking into account post-thaw vCD34% improved 
engraftment time in our patients; however, it came at the cost of unnecessary 
multi-day collections. The results from applying our predictive algorithm 
retrospectively to our data suggest that more than one-third of additional-day 
collections could have been avoided. Our investigation also identified CD45 nMFI 
as a novel marker for assessing HPC health post-thaw.","Copyright © 2023 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy. Published by

onco-hematological diseases, the first recently Food and Drug 
Administration-approved gene therapy product for patients with 
transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) indicates the feasibility of gene 
therapy as curative for genetic hematologic disorders. This work analyzed the 
current-world scenario of clinical trials involving gene therapy for 
β-hemoglobinopathies.
METHODS: Eighteen trials for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and 24 for 
patients with TDT were analyzed.
RESULTS: Most are phase 1 and 2 trials, funded by the industry and are currently 
recruiting volunteers. Treatment strategies for both diseases are fetal 
hemoglobin induction (52.4%); addition of wild-type or therapeutic β-globin gene 
(38.1%) and correction of mutations (9,5%). Gene editing (52.4%) and gene 
addition (40.5%) are the two most used techniques. The United States and France 
are the countries with the greatest number of clinical trials centers for SCD, 
with 83.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The United States (41.1%), China (26%) and 
Italy (6.8%) lead TDT trials centers.
CONCLUSIONS: Geographic trial concentration indicates the high costs of this 
technology, logistical issues and social challenges that need to be overcome for 
gene therapy to reach low- and middle-income countries where SCD and TDT are 
prevalent and where they most impact the patient's health.","Copyright © 2023 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy. Published by

Early diagnosis is crucial to improve the prognosis of patients with lung 
cancer. Plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contains comprehensive genetic 
and epigenetic information from tissues throughout the body, suggesting that 
early detection of lung cancer can be done non-invasively, conveniently, and 
cost-effectively using high-sensitivity techniques such as sequencing.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize the latest technological 
innovations, coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), regarding genomic 
alterations, methylation, and fragmentomic features of cfDNA for the early 
detection of lung cancer, as well as their clinical advances. Additionally, we 
discuss the suitability of study designs for diagnostic accuracy evaluation for 
different target populations and clinical questions.
EXPERT OPINION: Currently, cfDNA-based early screening and diagnosis of lung 
cancer faces many challenges, such as unsatisfactory performance, lack of 
quality control standards, and poor repeatability. However, the progress of 
several large prospective studies employing epigenetic features has shown 
promising predictive performance, which has inspired cfDNA sequencing for future 
clinical applications. Furthermore, the development of multi-omics markers for 
lung cancer, including genome-wide methylation and fragmentomics, is expected to 
play an increasingly important role in the future.","DOI: 10.1080/14737159.2023.2224504

combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic RAS wild-type, HER2-positive colorectal cancer who have received 
prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Approval was 
based on the pooled analysis of patients receiving tucatinib in combination with 
trastuzumab in MOUNTAINEER (NCT03043313), an open-label, multicenter trial. The 
primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 as per blinded 
central review committee (BIRC) assessment. The main secondary endpoint was 
duration of response (DOR) per BIRC assessment. Eighty-four eligible patients 
received the combination tucatinib-trastuzumab. With a median follow-up of 16 
months, the ORR was 38% (95% CI: 28, 49) and median DOR was 12.4 months (95% CI: 
8.5, 20.5); 81% of responders had a response lasting more than 6 months. The 
most common adverse reactions observed in at least 20% of patients receiving 
tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab were diarrhea, fatigue, rash, nausea, 
abdominal pain, infusion-related reactions, and fever. FDA concluded that the 
magnitude of ORR and durable responses observed in patients treated with 
tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab in the MOUNTAINEER trial are 
clinically meaningful, particularly in the context of a disease with estimated 
survival of 6-7 months with available therapy. This is the first approval for 
the subset of patients with HER2-positive colorectal cancer. This article

39% (n = 7) and 33% (n = 12) of patients enrolled in programs, and 30% (n = 4) 
and 14% (n = 5) of patients deferred enrollment. Patients and clinicians 
appreciated the referrals and choices. A printed handout describing both 
programs was added to the clinic workflow for Cycle 2, which yielded more 
referrals, but lower program enrollment rates. Clinic-based eReferrals to 
choices of physical activity programs were feasible and acceptable by clinicians 
and patients. Added clinic workflow support may facilitate referrals.","Plain Language Summary: Physical activity can improve the health, quality of 
life, and longevity among cancer survivors. Patients want to receive physical 
activity referrals and guidance from their cancer care team, but clinicians lack 
the knowledge, resources, time, and methods to counsel and refer their patients 
to community-based physical activity programs. One solution is to create a 
comprehensive electronic referral (eReferral) system giving cancer care 
clinicians the tools to support and refer their patients. We developed a simple 
eReferral that allows clinicians to refer patients to existing, evidence-based 
physical activity programs led by qualified exercise professions, LIVESTRONG at 
the YMCA (in-person) and Fit Cancer (virtual). We pilot tested the system with 
clinicians in two 12-week cycles. Clinicians were excited about the program and 
like the options they had to offer patients while providing suggestions on how 
we could better integrate it into their work environment. Patients appreciated 
the referral from their trusted cancer care clinician and appreciated choices of 
an in-person and virtual program to accommodate their preferences. To improve 
patient referrals and enrollment in physical activity programs, a more detailed 
printed handout that explains the benefits of physical activity in survivorship 
and describes each of the programs in detail may be helpful.","© Society of Behavioral Medicine 2023. All rights reserved. For permissions,

neoadjuvant treatment, anthracycline/platinum-based chemotherapy, in patients 
with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and germline BRCA 
mutations emphasizes the need for biomarker-targeted treatment, such as 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, in this setting. This phase II, 
single-arm, open-label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant 
talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutated early-stage TNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutated early-stage TNBC 
received talazoparib 1 mg once daily for 24 weeks (0.75 mg for moderate renal 
impairment) followed by surgery. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete 
response (pCR) by independent central review (ICR). Secondary endpoints included 
residual cancer burden (RCB) by ICR. Safety and tolerability of talazoparib and 
patient-reported outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 61 patients, 48 received ≥80% talazoparib doses, underwent surgery, 
and were assessed for pCR or progressed before pCR assessment and considered 
nonresponders. pCR rate was 45.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.0%-60.6%) 
and 49.2% (95% CI, 36.7%-61.6%) in the evaluable and intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population, respectively. RCB 0/I rate was 45.8% (95% CI, 29.4%-63.2%) and 50.8% 
(95% CI, 35.5%-66.0%) in the evaluable and ITT population, respectively. 
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were reported in 58 (95.1%) patients. 
Most common grade 3 and 4 TRAEs were anemia (39.3%) and neutropenia (9.8%). 
There was no clinically meaningful detriment in quality of life. No deaths 
occurred during the reporting period; 2 deaths due to progressive disease 
occurred during long-term follow-up (>400 days after first dose).
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant talazoparib monotherapy was active despite pCR rates 
not meeting the prespecified threshold; these rates were comparable to those 
observed with combination anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. 
Talazoparib was generally well tolerated.

provide an analytical framework for rigorous biomarker discovery. We implemented 
the ML pipeline to determine the predictive potential of clinical and 
immunoproteome antibody data for outcomes associated with Chlamydia trachomatis 
(Ct) infection collected from 222 cis-gender females with high Ct exposure. We 
compared the predictive performance of 4 ML algorithms (naive Bayes, random 
forest, extreme gradient boosting with linear booster [xgbLinear], and k-nearest 
neighbors [KNN]), screened from 215 ML methods, in combination with two 
different feature selection strategies, Boruta and recursive feature 
elimination. Recursive feature elimination performed better than Boruta in this 
study. In prediction of Ct ascending infection, naive Bayes yielded a slightly 
higher median value of are under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.59) than other methods and 
provided biological interpretability. For prediction of incident infection among 
women uninfected at enrollment, KNN performed slightly better than other 
algorithms, with a median AUROC of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.70). In contrast, 
xgbLinear and random forest had higher predictive performances, with median 
AUROC of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.67) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.64), 
respectively, for women infected at enrollment. Our findings suggest that 
clinical factors and serum anti-Ct protein IgGs are inadequate biomarkers for

utility of a pipeline that searches for biomarkers and evaluates prediction 
performance and interpretability. IMPORTANCE Biomarker discovery to aid early 
diagnosis and treatment using machine learning (ML) approaches is a rapidly 
developing area in host-microbe studies. However, lack of reproducibility and 
interpretability of ML-driven biomarker analysis hinders selection of robust 
biomarkers that can be applied in clinical practice. We thus developed a 
rigorous ML analytical framework and provide recommendations for enhancing 
reproducibility of biomarkers. We emphasize the importance of robustness in 
selection of ML methods, evaluation of performance, and interpretability of 
biomarkers. Our ML pipeline is reusable and open-source and can be used not only 
to identify host-pathogen interaction biomarkers but also in microbiome studies 
and ecological and environmental microbiology research.","DOI: 10.1128/spectrum.04689-22

(#)Contributed equally","Myxobacteria serve as a treasure trove of secondary metabolites. During our 
ongoing search for bioactive natural products, a novel subclass of disorazoles 
termed disorazole Z was discovered. Ten disorazole Z family members were 
purified from a large-scale fermentation of the myxobacterium Sorangium 
cellulosum So ce1875 and characterized by electrospray 
ionization-high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS), X-ray, nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR), and Mosher ester analysis. Disorazole Z compounds are 
characterized by the lack of one polyketide extension cycle, resulting in a 
shortened monomer in comparison to disorazole A, which finally forms a dimer in 
the bis-lactone core structure. In addition, an unprecedented modification of a 
geminal dimethyl group takes place to form a carboxylic acid methyl ester. The 
main component disorazole Z1 shows comparable activity in effectively killing 
cancer cells to disorazole A1 via binding to tubulin, which we show induces 
microtubule depolymerization, endoplasmic reticulum delocalization, and 
eventually apoptosis. The disorazole Z biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was 
identified and characterized from the alternative producer S. cellulosum So 
ce427 and compared to the known disorazole A BGC, followed by heterologous 
expression in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622. Pathway engineering by 
promoter substitution and gene deletion paves the way for detailed biosynthesis 
studies and efficient heterologous production of disorazole Z congeners. 
IMPORTANCE Microbial secondary metabolites are a prolific reservoir for the 
discovery of bioactive compounds, which prove to be privileged scaffolds for the 
development of new drugs such as antibacterial and small-molecule anticancer 
drugs. Consequently, the continuous discovery of novel bioactive natural 
products is of great importance for pharmaceutical research. Myxobacteria, 
especially Sorangium spp., which are known for their large genomes with 
yet-underexploited biosynthetic potential, are proficient producers of such 
secondary metabolites. From the fermentation broth of Sorangium cellulosum 
strain So ce1875, we isolated and characterized a family of natural products 
named disorazole Z, which showed potent anticancer activity. Further, we report 
on the biosynthesis and heterologous production of disorazole Z. These results 
can be stepping stones toward pharmaceutical development of the disorazole 
family of anticancer natural products for (pre)clinical studies.","DOI: 10.1128/spectrum.00730-23

report concerns the potential implication of liver (class I) and circulating

eight miRNAs were upregulated in both female and male mice exposed to TCDD. 
Inversely, the expression of nine miRNAs were significantly downregulated in 
both animal genders. Moreover, certain miRNAs were preferentially induced in 
either females or males. The potential downstream regulatory effects of miRNAs 
on their target genes was evaluated by determining the expression of three group 
of genes that are potentially involved in cancer biogenesis, other diseases and 
in hepatotoxicity. It was found that certain cancer-related genes were more 
highly expressed females rather than males after exposure to TCDD. Furthermore, 
a paradoxical female-to-male transcriptional pattern was found for several

responsible for one of the major cancer-related mortality in gastric cancer 
patients. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a natural product, exhibits anticancer 
activities in human many cancer cells, including gastric cancer. However, no 
available report shows AITC inhibits gastric cancer cell metastasis. Herein, we 
evaluated the impact of AITC on cell migration and invasion of human gastric 
cancer AGS cells in vitro. AITC at 5-20 μM did not induce significant cell 
morphological damages observed by contrast-phase microscopy but decreased cell 
viability assayed by flow cytometry. After AGS cells were further examined by 
atomic force microscopy (AFM), which indicated AITC affected cell membrane and 
morphology in AGS cells. AITC significantly suppressed cell motility examined by 
scratch wound healing assay. The results of the gelatin zymography assay 
revealed that AITC significantly suppressed the MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. In 
addition, AITC suppressed cell migration and invasion were performed by 
transwell chamber assays at 24 h in AGS cells. Furthermore, AITC inhibited cell 
migration and invasion by affecting PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways in AGS 
cells. The decreased expressions of p-AKTThr308 , GRB2, and Vimentin in AGS 
cells also were confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. Our findings suggest

well-being, many people opt to avoid learning this information due to its 
potentially threatening nature. Such avoidance can lead to delays in seeking 
treatment.
PURPOSE: This study tested the effectiveness of a self-regulation technique, 
mental contrasting (MC), specifically MC of a negative future with a positive 
current reality, in reducing health information avoidance regarding skin cancer 
(melanoma). We hypothesized that participants who engaged in MC would be more 
likely to choose to learn about their melanoma risk than those who completed a 
control, reflection activity.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (N = 354). Participants were 
assigned to complete a MC or reflection (control) exercise prior to filling out 
a melanoma risk calculator. Participants were then asked whether they wanted to 
learn their melanoma risk, and how much information they would like to know.
RESULTS: Chi-Square tests revealed that MC decreased melanoma risk information 
avoidance compared to the reflection activity (12% vs. 23.4%) but did not make 
participants more likely seek additional information.
CONCLUSION: MC is a brief, engaging, and effective strategy for reducing health 
information avoidance that could prove useful in medical settings.","Plain Language Summary: It is important to know about the status of one’s health 
in order to take necessary precautions for positive health outcomes. However, 
people may often engage in “information avoidance,” which is the tendency to 
neglect seeking available and potentially valuable health information. Avoiding 
health information, especially with regards to one’s risk for various diseases, 
is harmful because it can delay timely treatment. In this study, we tested the 
effectiveness of mental contrasting—a self-regulation technique—in reducing 
information avoidance for melanoma skin cancer risk. We recruited 354 
participants, and they were randomly assigned to engage in the mental 
contrasting exercise or reflection (control) exercise. The participants then 
filled out a melanoma risk calculator and were asked whether they would like to 
learn their risk for melanoma, and how much information they would like to know. 
The results showed that mental contrasting decreased melanoma risk information 
avoidance compared to the reflection activity (12% vs. 23.4%) but did not make 
participants more likely seek additional information. These findings suggest 
that mental contrasting can be a brief, engaging, and effective strategy for 
reducing health information avoidance.","© Society of Behavioral Medicine 2023. All rights reserved. For permissions,

with other racial/ethnic groups. Black women with breast cancer also evidence 
compromised quality of life in some domains. Culturally relevant aspects of 
their experience are understudied.
PURPOSE: The goal of this qualitative study was to examine the relevance of the 
Strong Black Woman schema in the cancer context.
METHODS: Three Gatherings (i.e., culturally curated focus groups) were conducted 
with Black women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and recruited from 
cancer-related listservs and events. A five-person team conducted reflexive 
thematic analysis of Gathering transcripts.
RESULTS: The 37 participants ranged in age (30 to 94 years) and in diagnosis 
duration (2 months to 29 years). Reflexive thematic analysis yielded six themes 
that characterized the women's experience: historical legacy of the Strong Black 
Woman, navigating intersecting Strong Black Woman identities, everyday 
challenges encountered on the battlefield by Strong Black Women, Strong Black 
Woman in action during the breast cancer journey, the complexities of seeking 
and accepting support, and the liberated Strong Black Woman. The schema's 
negative consequences included the oncologic team and others expecting the 
participants to be strong and not to need support. Expectations to suppress 
emotions and continue caring for others to the neglect of the self also were 
evident. Positive consequences included engaging in self-advocacy in the 
oncologic context and redefining strength to include expressing emotions and 
accepting help.
CONCLUSIONS: The Strong Black Woman schema is highly relevant in the breast 
cancer context and could be addressed in culturally centered interventions.","Plain Language Summary: Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Black American 
women diagnosed with breast cancer have the highest death rate and some aspects 
of their quality of life is lower. The authors developed Project SOAR (Speaking 
Our African American Realities) to shed light on the experiences of Black 
American women diagnosed with breast cancer. In one Project SOAR study, 37 women 
took part in Gatherings—small group meetings conducted in an all-Black, 
all-woman space—in which they talked about the relevance of the Strong Black 
Woman (or Black Superwoman) concept during breast cancer. Arising from a history 
of enslavement, the concept involves suppressing emotions, always acting strong, 
taking care of others while neglecting care of oneself, and declining others’ 
support. Gathering participants ranged in age (30 to 94 years) and time elapsed 
since diagnosis (2 months to 29 years). Their breast cancer experiences often 
corresponded with the Strong Black Woman concept. For example, some medical 
professionals and others expected them to act strong, to keep caring for others, 
not to need support, and not to voice their emotions during the cancer 
experience. Some women redefined strength to include expressing emotions and 
accepting help. The authors are developing resources for Black American women

imaging (MRI) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) for detecting myometrial 
invasion (MI) in patients with low-grade endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (Pubmed), Web of Science, Embase and 
Scopus (from January 1990 to December 2022) was performed for articles comparing 
TVS and MRI in the evaluation of myometrial infiltration in low-grade (grade 1 
or 2) endometrioid endometrial carcinoma in the same group of patients. We used 
QUADAS-2 tool for assessing the risk of bias of studies.
RESULTS: We found 104 citations in our extensive research. Four articles were 
ultimately included in the meta-analysis, after excluding 100 reports. All 
articles were considered low risk of bias in most of the domains assessed in 
QUADAS-2. We observed that pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting deep 
MI were 65% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 54%-75%) and 85% (95% CI = 79%-89%) 
for MRI, and 71% (95% CI = 63%-78%) and 76% (95% CI = 67%-83%) for TVS, 
respectively. No statistical differences were found between both imaging 
techniques (p > 0.05). We observed low heterogeneity for sensitivity and high 
for specificity regarding TVS; and moderate for both sensitivity and specificity 
in case of MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of TVS and MRI for the evaluation of 
deep MI in women with low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer is similar. 
However, further research is needed as the number of studies is scanty.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Ultrasound published by Wiley

program (PREOPtimize), consisting of Nordic Walking and resistance training 
exercises plus health education in patients with breast cancer who are receiving 
neoadjuvant therapy to enhance postoperative functionality of the affected arm. 
A secondary aim will be to compare the short-term effects of the intervention on 
other patient-reported outcome measures.
METHODS: This will be an assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial with a 
parallel group design conducted at a tertiary hospital. A sample of 64 patients 
with breast cancer scheduled for surgery and undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
will be recruited for the trial and randomly allocated to either a) a 
prehabilitation program consisting of 2 weekly sessions of 75 minutes of Nordic 
walking, muscle strengthening exercises, and health education sessions conducted 
between the fourth month of treatment and surgery or b) usual care. Patients in 
both groups will be assessed at baseline, before surgery, and at 1 and 3 months 
after surgery. Assessed outcomes include functionality of the affected arm 
(QuickDash), arm volume, range of motion, handgrip strength, pain, fatigue, 
functional capacity, physical activity levels and health-related quality of 
life. Adherence to the intervention in the prehabilitation group and adverse 
events will also be recorded.
IMPACT: Prehabilitation for patients affected by breast cancer is rarely 
implemented in clinical practice. The results obtained with the PREOPtimize 
trial could show that prehabilitation is a feasible intervention for patients 
with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy that might enhance 
postoperative recovery of upper arm function as well as improve overall physical 
performance and health-related quality of life.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

tumors globally. Former investigations discovered that circular RNAs (circRNAs) 
play an important role in PC development. circRNAs belong to a new class of 
endogenous noncoding RNAs, which have been found to mediate the progression of 
diverse types of tumors. Nevertheless, the roles of circRNAs and the underlying 
regulatory mechanisms in PC remain unknown.Methods: In this study, our team 
employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to examine the abnormal circRNA 
expression in PC tissues. The circRNA expression in PC cell lines and tissues 
was detected. Then, regulatory mechanism and targets were examined with 
bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporting analysis, Transwell migration, 
5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and CCK-8 analysis. An in vivo experiment was 
employed to elucidate hsa_circ_0014784 roles in PC tumor growth and 
metastasis.Results: The results showcased abnormal circRNA expression in PC 
tissues. Our lab also found that hsa_circ_0014784 expression incremented in PC 
tissues and cell lines, implying that hsa_circ_0014784 functioned in PC 
progression. hsa_circ_0014784 downregulation inhibited PC proliferation and 
invasion in vivo and in vitro. The bioinformatics and luciferase report data 
validated that both miR-214-3p and YAP1 were hsa_circ_0014784 binding partners. 
The overexpression of YAP1 reversed the migration, proliferation, and epithelial 
- mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC cells and the angiogenic differentiation of 
HUVECs after miR-214-3p overexpression.Conclusion: Taken together, our study 
found that hsa_circ_0014784 downregulation decremented invasion, proliferation, 
EMT, and angiogenesis of PC by regulating miR-214-3p/YAP1 signaling.","DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2023.2222519

organs, and are sites for cancer and metastasis formation. In vitro models 
recapitulating bone- and bone marrow-specific functions, including 
vascularization, that are compatible with drug screening are highly desirable. 
Such models can bridge the gap between simplistic, structurally irrelevant 
two-dimensional (2D) in vitro models and the more expensive, ethically 
challenging in vivo models. This article describes a controllable 
three-dimensional (3D) co-culture assay based on engineered poly(ethylene 
glycol) (PEG) matrices for the generation of vascularized, osteogenic 
bone-marrow niches. The PEG matrix design allows the development of 3D cell 
cultures through a simple cell seeding step requiring no encapsulation, thus 
enabling the development of complex co-culture systems. Furthermore, the 
matrices are transparent and pre-cast onto glass-bottom 96-well imaging plates, 
rendering the system suitable for microscopy. For the assay described here, 
human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) are cultured 
first until a sufficiently developed 3D cell network is formed. Subsequently, 
GFP-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are added. The 
culture development is followed by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. The 
presence of the hBM-MSC network supports the formation of vascular-like 
structures that otherwise would not form and that remain stable for at least 7 
days. The extent of vascular-like network formation can easily be quantified. 
This model can be tuned toward an osteogenic bone-marrow niche by supplementing 
the culture medium with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which promotes the 
osteogenic differentiation of the hBM-MSCs, as assessed by increased alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) activity at day 4 and day 7 of co-culture. This cellular model 
can be used as a platform for culturing various cancer cells and studying how 
they interact with bone- and bone marrow-specific vascular niches. Moreover, it 
is suitable for automation and high-content analyses, meaning it would enable 
cancer drug screening under highly reproducible culture conditions.","DOI: 10.3791/65413

study. The mechanical properties of a cell are similar to those of a material. A 
cell's resistance to stress and strain, its relaxation time, and its elasticity 
are all properties that can be derived and compared to other types of cells. 
Quantifying the mechanical properties of cancerous (malignant) versus normal 
(non-malignant) cells allows researchers to further uncover the biophysical 
fundamentals of this disease. While the mechanical properties of cancer cells 
are known to consistently differ from the mechanical properties of normal cells, 
a standard experimental procedure to deduce these properties from cells in 
culture is lacking. This paper outlines a procedure to quantify the mechanical 
properties of single cells in vitro using a fluid shear assay. The principle 
behind this assay involves applying fluid shear stress onto a single cell and 
optically monitoring the resulting cellular deformation over time. Cell 
mechanical properties are subsequently characterized using digital image 
correlation (DIC) analysis and fitting an appropriate viscoelastic model to the 
experimental data generated from the DIC analysis. Overall, the protocol 
outlined here aims to provide a more effective and targeted method for the 
diagnosis of difficult-to-treat cancers.","DOI: 10.3791/65333

supports multifaceted biosynthetic, bioenergetic, and signaling functions in 
mammalian cells. As oxygen (O2) is the most ubiquitous terminal electron 
acceptor for the mammalian ETC, the O2 consumption rate is frequently used as a 
proxy for mitochondrial function. However, emerging research demonstrates that 
this parameter is not always indicative of mitochondrial function, as fumarate 
can be employed as an alternative electron acceptor to sustain mitochondrial 
functions in hypoxia. This article compiles a series of protocols that allow 
researchers to measure mitochondrial function independently of the O2

mitochondrial function in hypoxic environments. Specifically, we describe 
methods to measure mitochondrial ATP production, de novo pyrimidine 
biosynthesis, NADH oxidation by complex I, and superoxide production. In 
combination with classical respirometry experiments, these orthogonal and 
economical assays will provide researchers with a more comprehensive assessment

biosimilars versus the reference rituximab from the perspective of the Jordanian 
national health payer.
METHODS: A 1-year cost-efficiency and expanded access model of conversion from 
reference rituximab (Mabthera) to the approved biosimilars (Truxima, Rixathon, 
and Tromax) to assess five metrics: total annual cost to treat a hypothetical 
patient; head-to-head cost comparison; changes in patients' access to rituximab; 
number-needed-to-convert (NNC) to provide an additional 10 patients access to a 
rituximab treatment; and relative amount of Jordanian Dinar (JOD) spent on 
rituximab options. The model included rituximab doses at 100mg/10ml and 
500mg/50ml and considered both cost-saving and cost-wastage scenarios. Costs of 
treatments were based on fiscal year 2022 tender prices received by the Joint 
Procurement Department (JPD).
RESULTS: Rixathon was associated with the lowest average annual cost per patient 
(JOD2,860) across all six indications among all rituximab comparators, followed 
by Truxima (JOD4,240), Tromax (JOD4,365) and reference Mabthera (JOD11,431). The 
highest percentage of patient access to rituximab treatment (321%) was achieved 
when switching patients from Mabthera to Rixathon in the RA and PV indications. 
At four patients, Rixathon was associated with the lowest NNC to provide an 
additional 10 patients access to a rituximab treatment. For each JOD1 spent on 
Rixathon, an additional JOD3.21 must be spent on Mabthera, an additional JOD0.55 
on Tromax, and an additional JOD0.53 on Truxima.
CONCLUSION: Rituximab biosimilars were associated with cost savings in all 
approved indications in Jordan compared to reference rituximab. Rixathon was 
associated with the lowest annual cost, the highest percentage of expanded 
patient access for all six indications, and the lowest NNC providing 10 
additional patients with access.","DOI: 10.1080/13696998.2023.2226007

reasons other than suspected adrenal disease. In most cases, adrenal 
incidentalomas are non-functioning adrenocortical adenomas, but may also require 
therapeutic intervention including that for adrenocortical carcinoma, 
pheochromocytoma, hormone-producing adenoma or metastases. Here, we provide a 
revision of the first international, interdisciplinary guidelines on 
incidentalomas. We followed the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation) system and updated systematic reviews on four 
predefined clinical questions crucial for the management of incidentalomas: A) 
How to assess risk of malignancy? ; B) How to define and manage mild autonomous 
cortisol secretion? ; C) Who should have surgical treatment and how should it be 
performed? ; D) What follow-up is indicated if the adrenal incidentaloma is not 
surgically removed? Selected Recommendations: 1) Each adrenal mass requires 
dedicated adrenal imaging. Recent advances now allow discrimination between risk 
categories: Homogeneous lesions with HU ≤ 10 on unenhanced CT are benign and do 
not require any additional imaging independent of size. All other patients 
should be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert meeting, but only lesions 
>4 cm that are inhomogeneous or have HU >20 have sufficiently high risk of 
malignancy that surgery will be the usual management of choice. 2) Every patient 
needs a thorough clinical and endocrine work-up to exclude hormone excess 
including the measurement of plasma or urinary metanephrines and a 1-mg 
overnight dexamethasone suppression test (applying a cutoff value of serum 
cortisol ≤50 nmol/l (≤1.8 µg/dl)). Recent studies have provided evidence that 
most patients without clinical signs of overt Cushing's syndrome but serum 
cortisol levels post dexamethasone >50 nmol/l (>1.8 µg/dl) harbor increased risk 
of morbidity and mortality. For this condition, we propose the term 'mild 
autonomous cortisol secretion' (MACS). 3) All patients with MACS should be 
screened for potential cortisol-related comorbidities that are potentially 
attributably to cortisol (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus), to 
ensure these are appropriately treated. 4) In patients with MACS who also have 
relevant comorbidities surgical treatment should be considered in an 
individualized approach. 5) The appropriateness of surgical intervention should 
be guided by the likelihood of malignancy, the presence and degree of hormone 
excess, age, general health and patient preference. We provide guidance on which 
surgical approach should be considered for adrenal masses with radiological 
findings suspicious of malignancy. 6) Surgery is not usually indicated in 
patients with an asymptomatic, non-functioning unilateral adrenal mass and 
obvious benign features on imaging studies. Furthermore, we offer 
recommendations for the follow-up of non-operated patients, management of 
patients with bilateral incidentalomas, for patients with extra-adrenal 
malignancy and adrenal masses, and for young and elderly patients with adrenal 
incidentalomas. Finally, we suggest ten important research questions for the 
future.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of European

biological processes and human diseases, including ovarian cancer (OC). 
miR-5590-3p has been involved in multiple malignant solid tumors, but its exact 
role in the progression of OC is largely unknown. This study mainly focuses on 
how miR-5590-3p works in OC and illuminating the underlying mechanism. We found 
that miR-5590-3p was significantly downregulated in human OC cell lines and 
patient tissues. Cell counting 8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays proved that 
overexpression or inhibition of miR-5590-3p suppressed or promoted cell 
proliferation and cell invasion. Subsequently, TNIK was identified as a target 
of miR-5590-3p. Silence of TNIK by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the 
increasing effect of miR-5590-3p inhibition on cell proliferation and invasion 
in OC cell lines. Furthermore, our results showed that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway 
was inhibited by its specific inhibitor XAV-939, but miR-5590-3p inhibitor and 
adenoviral TNIK overexpression vector (Ad-TNIK) reactivated the activation of 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling and increased cell malignancy. Lastly, tumorigenicity 
assay demonstrated that inhibition of miR-5590-3p increased tumor volume and 
weight in vivo. In conclusion, miR-5590-3p may function as a cancer suppressor 
gene in OC progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by transcriptionally 
suppressing TNIK expression, which provides a potential therapeutic approach for 
ovarian cancer treatment.","©The Author(s) 2023. Open Access. This article is licensed under a Creative

triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Macrophages, accounting for up to 50% of 
the TNBC tumor mass, are involved in innate and adaptive immunity, which can 
serve as an effective weapon against TNBC via combined immunotherapy. Here, we 
engineered mannose and glycocholic acid-modified trimethyl chitosan (MTG) 
nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) siRNA 
(siSIRPα, a macrophage checkpoint inhibitor) and mucin 1 (MUC1) pDNA (pMUC1, a 
therapeutic pDNA vaccine) (MTG/siSIRPα/pMUC1 NPs) for in situ educating 
macrophages via an oral route to exert the cooperative antitumor effects of 
siSIRPα and pMUC1. Orally delivered MTG-based NPs accumulated in the macrophages 
in lymph nodes and tumor tissues via the intestinal lymphatic transport pathway, 
leading to strong cellular immunity responses. Following the transfection of 
orally administered MTG/siSIRPα/pMUC1 NPs within the same macrophages, siSIRPα 
strengthened the pMUC1 vaccine-induced systemic cellular immunity, while pMUC1 
enhanced siSIRPα-mediated macrophage phagocytosis, M1-phenotype polarization, 
and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling at the tumor sites, thereby 
inhibiting the growth and metastasis of TNBC. The simultaneous achievements of 
the mutual promotion of innate and adaptive immunity in the local TME and in the 
whole body suggested that MTG/siSIRPα/pMUC1 NPs would provide a promising 
paradigm for the combined immunotherapy of TNBC via oral delivery of genes.","DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.3c02985

leading to immune escape and therapeutic resistance. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) 
have a unique electrical structure and are characterized by a high solubility 
for gases. PFC-based oxygen carriers have been evaluated for their ability to 
deliver oxygen effectively to hypoxic tissues, and significant clinical 
translation has been demonstrated. And due to the unique acoustic activity, PFCs 
have been employed to stabilize the injection of gas microbubbles (MBs) as 
clinical ultrasonography contrast agents. In contrast, the ultrasound and 
photothermally activatable PFC phase-shift nanodroplets (P-SNDs) represent a 
novel alternative to ultrasound imaging and hypoxia improvement. The PFC-based 
oxygen carriers may be utilized to improve the efficacy of cancer treatments 
based on synergistic radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CMT), and photodynamic 
therapy (PDT) to reshape the tumor microenvironment through synergistic 
immunotherapy (IMT) and to achieve precise tumor diagnosis using acoustic 
imaging. This review described the characteristics of PFCs to provide an update 
on the design of PFC delivery systems used for oxygen delivery and ultrasound

to excessive inflammation, massive cell death, and restricted regenerative 
potential, leading to maladaptive healing process and eventually heart failure. 
Current strategies of regulating inflammation or improving cardiac tissue 
regeneration have limited success. Herein, a hybrid hydrogel coassembled by 
acellular cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunomodulatory glycopeptide 
is developed for endogenous tissue regeneration after MI. The hydrogel 
constructs a niche recapitulating the architecture of native ECM for attracting 
host cell homing, controlling macrophage differentiation via glycopeptide unit, 
and promoting endotheliocyte proliferation by enhancing the 
macrophage-endotheliocyte crosstalk, which coordinate the innate healing 
mechanism for cardiac tissue regeneration. In a rodent MI model, the hybrid 
hydrogel successfully orchestrates a proreparative response indicated by 
enhanced M2 macrophage polarization, increased angiogenesis, and improved 
cardiomyocyte survival, which alleviates infarct size, improves wall 
thicknesses, and enhances cardiac contractility. Furthermore, the safety and 
effectiveness of the hydrogel are demonstrated in a porcine MI model, wherein 
proteomics verifies the regulation of immune response, proangiogenesis, and 
accelerated healing process. Collectively, the injectable composite hydrogel

Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.","Depth of invasion through the intestinal wall, categorized as primary tumor 
stage (pT), is an important prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, 
additional variables that may affect clinical behavior among tumors involving 
the muscularis propria (pT2) have not been examined at length. We evaluated 109 
patients with pT2 colonic adenocarcinomas (median age: 71 y, interquartile 
range: 59 to 79 y) along various clinicopathologic parameters, including 
invasion depth, regional lymph node involvement, and disease progression after 
resection. Tumors extending to the outer muscularis propria (termed pT2b) were 
associated in multivariate analysis with older patient age (P=0.04), larger 
tumor size (P<0.001), higher likelihood of lymphovascular invasion (LVI; P=0.03) 
and higher lymph node stage (pN; P=0.04), compared with tumors limited to the 
inner muscle layer (pT2a), and LVI was the single most important variable 
predicting regional lymph node metastasis at resection in these tumors 
(P=0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis during a median clinical follow-up of 59.7 
months (interquartile range: 31.5 to 91.2) revealed that disease progression was 
more likely in pT2 tumors that exhibited, at the time of staging: size >2.5 cm 
(P=0.039), perineural invasion (PNI; P=0.047), high-grade tumor budding 
(P=0.036), higher pN stage (P=0.002), and distant metastasis (P<0.001). 
Proportional hazards (Cox) regression identified high-grade tumor budding 
(P=0.02) as independently predicting shorter progression-free survival in pT2 
tumors. Finally, among cases that would not ordinarily be candidates for 
adjuvant treatment (ie, pT2N0M0), the presence of high-grade tumor budding was 
significantly associated with disease progression (P=0.04). These data suggest 
that, during the diagnosis of pT2 tumors, pathologists may wish to pay 
particular attention and ensure adequate reporting of certain variables such as 
tumor size, depth of invasion within the muscularis propria (ie, pT2a vs. pT2b), 
LVI, PNI, and, especially, tumor budding, as these may affect clinical treatment 
decisions and proper patient prognostication.","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000002072

James Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.","INTRODUCTION: The Healthy People 2030 initiative has set national cancer 
screening targets at 77.1%, 74.4% and 84.3% for breast, colon, and cervical 
cancers, respectively. We sought to assess the association between historical 
redlining relative and present-day social vulnerability on screening targets for 
breast, colon, and cervical cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: Data on national census-tract level cancer screening prevalence 
and social vulnerability index (SVI) in 2020 was extracted from the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) PLACES and CDC SVI databases, respectively. Census tracts 
were then assigned Home-Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades (A: ""Best"", B: 
""Still Desirable"", C: ""Definitely Declining"" and D: ""Hazardous/Redlined""). 
Mixed-effects logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the association between HOLC grades and achievement cancer screening 
targets.
RESULT: Among 11,831 census tracts, 3,712 were classified as redlined (A: n=842, 
7.1% vs. B: n=2,314, 19.6% vs. C: n=4,963, 42.0% vs. D: n=3,712, 31.4%). 
Notably, 62.8% (n=7,427), 21.2% (n=2,511) and 27.3% (n=3,235) of tracts met 
screening targets for breast, colon, and cervical cancer, respectively. After 
adjusting for present-day SVI and access to care metrics (population to primary 
care physician ratio and distance to nearest healthcare facility), redlined 
tracts were markedly less likely to meet breast (OR: 0.76, 95%CI 0.64-0.91), 
colon (OR: 0.34, 95%CI 0.28-0.41) and cervical (OR: 0.21, 95%CI 0.16-0.27) 
cancer screening targets compared with the ""Best"" tracts. Notably, poverty, lack 
of education and limited English proficiency, amongst others, mediated the 
adverse effect of historical redlining on cancer screening.
CONCLUSION: Redlining as a surrogate for structural racism continues to 
adversely impact cancer screening. Policies that aim to make access to 
preventive cancer care more equitable for historically marginalized communities 
should be a public priority.","Copyright © 2023 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by Wolters

specific consensus regarding the optimal level of inferior mesenteric artery 
(IMA) ligation does not exist.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effects of different IMA ligation 
methods on the prognosis of patients with low RC, so as to further guide 
clinical treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2013 and December 2018, 158 patients with 
low RC underwent LAR. According to the IMA ligation method used, the cases were 
divided into the low-ligation group (LL group; n = 66) and the high-ligation 
group (HL group; n = 92). The basic information, operation indicators, 
postoperative data, and long-term survival in the 2 groups were compared.
RESULTS: Sixty cases in the HL group and 60 cases in the LL group were 
successfully matched using propensity score matching (PSM). There were no 
statistically significant differences in intraoperative bleeding, intraoperative 
time, postoperative hospital stay, harvested lymph nodes (LNs), postoperative 
complications (including urinary retention, urinary incontinence, anastomotic 
leaks, bowel obstruction, incisional infection, and anal function 3 months after 
surgery), overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local recurrence, 
and distant metastasis between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). Compared with the HL 
group, the time to first flatus and the time to fluid intake were shorter in the 
LL group (p < 0.05).

OBJECTIVES: The study's primary aim was to examine the effectiveness of 
exergaming in reducing CRF; the secondary aims were to improve functional 
capacity/endurance and promote physical activity (PA) among children with acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: In this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), 45 children aged 6-14 years 
were randomly assigned into group-I, n = 22, and group II, n = 23. Group-I 
played exergaming of moderate intensity for 60 min, twice a week for three 
weeks. Group II was given an instructional session regarding the benefits of PA 
with advice to practice PA for 60 min twice a week. CRF, functional 
capacity/endurance, and PA were measured using the pediatric quality of life 
multidimensional fatigue scale (Ped-QLMFS), six-minute walk test (6-MWT), and 
Godin-Shepard Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (QSLTPAQ) 
respectively. All measurements were taken thrice; in the first, third, and fifth 
weeks of intervention.
RESULTS: Group-I demonstrated a significant reduction of CRF, and a significant 
increase of functional capacity/endurance compared to group-II over the five 
weeks study period. The effect of time × intervention interaction was 
significant. Based on Cohen's guidelines, CRF and functional capacity/endurance 
had large effect sizes (η2 = 0.41, p = .00) and (η2 = 0.27, p = .00)

assessment of strength and functional status in patients with cancer, in 
particular with cancer cachexia. The aim was to prospectively evaluate the 
prognostic value of HGS in patients with mostly advanced cancer with and without 
cachexia and to establish reference values for a European-based population.
METHODS: In this prospective study, 333 patients with cancer (85% stage III/IV) 
and 65 healthy controls of similar age and sex were enrolled. None of the study 
participants had significant cardiovascular disease or active infection at 
baseline. Repetitive HGS assessment was performed using a hand dynamometer to 
measure the maximal HGS (kilograms). Presence of cancer cachexia was defined 
when patients had ≥5% weight loss within 6 months or when body mass index was 
<20.0 kg/m2 with ≥2% weight loss (Fearon's criteria). Cox proportional hazard 
analyses were performed to assess the relationship of maximal HGS to all-cause 
mortality and to determine cut-offs for HGS with the best predictive power. We 
also assessed associations with additional relevant clinical and functional 
outcome measures at baseline, including anthropometric measures, physical 
function (Karnofsky Performance Status and Eastern Cooperative of Oncology 
Group), physical activity (4-m gait speed test and 6-min walk test), 
patient-reported outcomes (EQ-5D-5L and Visual Analogue Scale appetite/pain) and 
nutrition status (Mini Nutritional Assessment).
RESULTS: The mean age was 60 ± 14 years; 163 (51%) were female, and 148 (44%) 
had cachexia at baseline. Patients with cancer showed 18% lower HGS than healthy 
controls (31.2 ± 11.9 vs. 37.9 ± 11.6 kg, P < 0.001). Patients with cancer 
cachexia had 16% lower HGS than those without cachexia (28.3 ± 10.1 vs. 
33.6 ± 12.3 kg, P < 0.001). Patients with cancer were followed for a mean of 
17 months (range 6-50), and 182 (55%) patients died during follow-up (2-year 
mortality rate 53%) (95% confidence interval 48-59%). Reduced maximal HGS was 
associated with increased mortality (per -5 kg; hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; 
1.10-1.28; P < 0.0001; independently of age, sex, cancer stage, cancer entity 
and presence of cachexia). HGS was also a predictor of mortality in patients 
with cachexia (per -5 kg; HR 1.20; 1.08-1.33; P = 0.001) and without cachexia 
(per -5 kg; HR 1.18; 1.04-1.34; P = 0.010). The cut-off for maximal HGS with the 
best predictive power for poor survival was <25.1 kg for females (sensitivity 
54%, specificity 63%) and <40.2 kg for males (sensitivity 69%, specificity 68%).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced maximal HGS was associated with higher all-cause mortality, 
reduced overall functional status and decreased physical performance in patients 
with mostly advanced cancer. Similar results were found for patients with and 
without cancer cachexia.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John

demonstrated to significantly decrease colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and 
mortality. Among resection techniques, cold snare polypectomy (CSP) has been 
shown as a highly feasible, effective and safe option and is widely used in 
clinical practice, being regarded as the first-line technique for removal of 
small and diminutive colorectal polyps. On the other hand, conventional hot 
snare polypectomy (HSP) and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), namely the gold 
standard treatments for larger polyps, may be occasionally associated to 
complications due to electrocautery injury.
AREAS COVERED: To overcome these shortcomings of electrocautery-based resection 
techniques, in the last few years CSP has been increasingly assessed as a 
treatment option for additional indications, with a focus on nonpedunculated 
colorectal polyps ≥10 mm.

CSP discussing the latest findings from the most remarkable studies, with an

microenvironment (TME) during radiation therapy (RT) of breast cancer result in 
RT resistance and thus reduced therapeutic efficacy. In addition, 
immunosuppression induced by the TME severely limits the antitumor immunity of 
radiation therapy. In this paper, we propose a PCN-224@IrNCs/D-Arg nanoplatform 
for the synergistic radiosensitization, photodynamic, and NO therapy of breast 
cancer that also boosts antitumor immunity (PCN = porous coordination network, 
IrNCs = iridium nanocrystals, D-Arg = D-arginine). The local tumors can be 
selectively ablated via reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME), 
photodynamic therapy (PDT) and NO therapy, and the presence of the high-Z 
element Ir that sensitizes radiotherapy. The synergistic execution of these 
treatment modalities also resulted in adapted antitumor immune response. The 
intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of the nanoplatform also repolarize 
macrophages toward the M1 phenotype and induce dendritic cell maturation,

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer risk related to smoking. To 
investigate the association between a low-inflammatory diet, smoking status, and 
the risk of COPD and lung cancer. A total of 171 050 COPD-free and lung 
cancer-free (mean age: 55.80) individuals were included in this study. COPD and 
lung cancer were defined as hospital admission. An inflammatory diet index (IDI) 
was developed based on C-reactive protein levels and was a weighted sum of 34 
food groups. Participants were grouped into tertiles corresponding to IDI scores 
(lowest, middle, and highest). Over 2 091 071 person-years of follow-up, a total 
of 4007 individuals developed COPD (person-years: 2 075 579), and 1049 developed 
lung cancer. In comparison with the highest tertile of the IDI score, hazard 
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of COPD and lung cancer related 
to a low-inflammatory diet were 0.66 (0.61, 0.72) and 0.76 (0.65, 0.89), 
respectively. A low-inflammatory diet may prolong COPD onset by 1.88 (1.50, 
2.27) years and lung cancer onset by 1.05 (0.45, 1.65) years. In joint effect 
analyses, participants with the lowest/middle IDI score and smoking had a 
significant 37% decrease in COPD risk and a 35% decrease in lung cancer risk 
compared to the participants with the highest IDI score and smoking. Replacing 
each standard deviation unit (≈1080.426 g day-1) of pro-inflammatory foods with 
anti-inflammatory foods was associated with a 30% lower COPD risk. Our findings 
suggest that a low-inflammatory diet may significantly mitigate the risk of 
smoking on COPD development, and delay the COPD onset by about 2 years. However, 
a low-inflammatory diet is associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer among 
only smokers. Substituting equal intake of pro-inflammatory foods with 
anti-inflammatory foods is related to a decreased risk of COPD, but not lung 
cancer.","DOI: 10.1039/d2fo03429h

childhood cancer survivors (CCSs).
METHODS: The study included 3199 patients of the French Childhood Cancer 
Survivor Study cohort, with 303 patients with obesity who had returned the 
self-questionnaire. Analyses were adjusted for social deprivation index and sex.
RESULTS: CCSs were less likely to have obesity (9.5%; 95% CI: 8.5%-10.5%) than 
expected from the general French population rates (12.5%; p = 0.0001). 
Nevertheless, brain tumor survivors were significantly more likely to develop 
obesity than the general French population (p = 0.0001). Compared with patients 
who did not receive radiotherapy to the pituitary gland, those who received a 
dose >5 Gy had an increased risk of obesity: relative risk 1.9 (95% CI: 
1.2-3.1), 2.5 (95% CI: 1.7-3.7), and 2.6 (95% CI: 1.6-4.3), respectively, for 
participants with 6 to 20 Gy, 20 to 40 Gy, and ≥40 Gy of radiation. Etoposide 
administration significantly increased the risk of obesity (relative risk 1.7; 
95% CI: 1.1-2.6). High social deprivation index was also a risk factor, just

(aqueous panobinostat) delivered by convection enhanced delivery (CED) in 
patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) who 
completed focal radiation therapy (RT).
METHODS: Patients with DIPG (2-21 years) were enrolled after RT. CED of MTX110 
combined with gadoteridol was completed across seven dose levels (DL) (30-90 µM; 
volumes ranging from 3 mL to two consecutive doses of 6 mL). An accelerated dose 
escalation design was used. Distribution of infusate was monitored with 
real-time MR imaging. Repeat CED was performed every 4-8 weeks. Quality of life 
(QOL) assessments were obtained at baseline, every 3 months on therapy, and end 
of therapy.
RESULTS: Between May 2018-March 2020 seven patients, who received a total of 48 
CED infusions, were enrolled (median age 8 years, range 5-21). Three patients 
experienced dose-limited toxicities. Four grade 3 treatment related adverse 
events were observed. Most toxicities were transient new or worsening neurologic 
function. Median overall survival (OS) was 26.1 months (95% CI: 14.8-not 
reached). Progression free survival was 4-14 months (median, 7). Cumulative 
percentage of tumor coverage for combined CED infusions per patient ranged from 
35.6-81.0%. Increased CED infusions was negatively associated with self-reported 
QOL assessments.
CONCLUSION: Repeat CED of MTX110 with real time imaging with gadoteridol is 
tolerable for patients with DIPG. Median OS of 26.1 months compares favorably 
with historical data for children with DIPG. The results support further 
investigation of this strategy in a larger cohort.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

women with positive human papillomavirus (HPV) results, but it suffers from 
subjectivity and a lack of sensitivity and reproducibility. The diagnostic 
performance of an artificial intelligence-enabled liquid-based cytology (AI-LBC) 
triage approach remains unclear. Here, we compared the clinical performance of 
AI-LBC, human cytologists and HPV16/18 genotyping at triaging HPV-positive 
women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: HPV-positive women were triaged using AI-LBC, human 
cytologists and HPV16/18 genotyping. Histologically confirmed cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or higher (CIN2+/CIN3+) were accepted as 
thresholds for clinical performance assessments.
RESULTS: Of the 3514 women included, 13.9% (n = 489) were HPV-positive. The 
sensitivity of AI-LBC was comparable to that of cytologists (86.49% vs 83.78%, 
P = 0.744) but substantially higher than HPV16/18 typing at detecting CIN2+ 
(86.49% vs 54.05%, P = 0.002). While the specificity of AI-LBC was significantly 
lower than HPV16/18 typing (51.33% vs 87.17%, P < 0.001), it was significantly 
higher than cytologists at detecting CIN2+ (51.33% vs 40.93%, P < 0.001). AI-LBC 
reduced referrals to colposcopy by approximately 10%, compared with cytologists 
(51.53% vs 60.94%, P = 0.003). Similar patterns were also observed for CIN3+.
CONCLUSIONS: AI-LBC has equivalent sensitivity and higher specificity compared 
with cytologists, with more efficient colposcopy referrals for HPV-positive 
women. AI-LBC could be particularly useful in regions where experienced 
cytologists are few in number. Further investigations are needed to determine 
triaging performance through prospective designs.","© 2023 The Authors. Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica published by

for patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with tumor mutational 
burden (TMB) of ≥ 10 mutations/megabase. However, the clinical implications of 
this universal cutoff of TMB ≥ 10 for patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remain debatable.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss the tissue agnostic approval of 
pembrolizumab, its efficacy, and clinical relevance in the management of 
patients with MSS CRC patients with high TMB (defined as TMB ≥ 10). We also 
elaborate on molecular subgroups of MSS CRC that influence the immune checkpoint 
inhibitor (ICI) response for patients with MSS CRC, including pathogenic POLE 
and POLD1 mutations associated with ultramutated tumors.
EXPERT OPINION: Patients with microsatellite stable CRC with TMB ≥ 10 without 
POLE and POLD1 mutations may not benefit significantly from immune checkpoint 
inhibitors therapy. Predetermined cutoff TMB ≥ 10 mutation per MB does not seem 
to define a universal cutoff for the benefit of disease-agnostic ICI therapy, 
particularly for patients with MSS CRC. Patients with POLE/POLD1 mutations with 
MSS CRC represent a unique biological subgroup of MSS CRC with favorable 
responses to ICI therapy.","DOI: 10.1080/14712598.2023.2226327

dyspareunia and other urogenital symptoms because it may reverse some 
pathophysiological mechanisms associated with decreasing endocrine function and 
increasing aging. Over the years, several vaginal products including different 
formulations (tablets, rings, capsules, pessaries, creams, gels and ovules) and 
molecules (estradiol [E2], estriol [E3], promestriene, conjugated equine 
estrogens and estrone) have been used with superimposable therapeutic results. 
Low-dose and ultra-low-dose LET is the gold standard due to its minimal systemic 
absorption, with circulating E2 levels persistently remaining in the 
postmenopausal range. In healthy postmenopausal women, preference among the 
various products is presently the main driver and dissatisfaction with LET seems 
high, namely because of the delayed use in those with severe symptoms of 
genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Specific concerns remain in high-risk 
populations such as breast cancer survivors (BCS), especially those under 
treatment with aromatase inhibitors. Based on the multitude of symptoms under 
the umbrella of GSM definition, which includes vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), it is 
mandatory to investigate specific effects of LET on quality of life, sexual 
function and genitourinary conditions by conducting studies with a

years and is a major cause of functional loss. Chronic pain is a common nonmotor 
symptom that affects up to 80% of patients with (Pw) PD both in prodromal phases 
and during the subsequent stages of the disease, negatively affecting patient's 
quality of life and function. Pain in PwPD is rather heterogeneous and may occur 
because of different mechanisms. Targeting motor symptoms by dopamine 
replacement or with neuromodulatory approaches may only partially control 
PD-related pain. Pain in general has been classified in PwPD according to the 
motor signs, pain dimensions, or pain subtypes. Recently, a new classification 
framework focusing on chronic pain was introduced to group different types of PD 
pains according to mechanistic descriptors: nociceptive, neuropathic, or neither 
nociceptive nor neuropathic. This is also in line with the International 
Classification of Disease-11, which acknowledges the possibility of chronic 
secondary musculoskeletal or nociceptive pain due to disease of the CNS. In this 
narrative review and opinion article, a group of basic and clinical scientists 
revise the mechanism of pain in PD and the challenges faced when classifying it 
as a stepping stone to discuss an integrative view of the current classification 
approaches and how clinical practice can be influenced by them. Knowledge gaps

gastric cancer (GC), however the accurate and sensitive detection of 
low-abundance proteins in early-stage GC is still a challenge. Herein, a 
surface-enhanced Raman scattering frequency shift assay was performed on a 
developed microfluidic chip for the detection of GC protein biomarkers 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 
The chip is made up of three groups of parallel channels and each parallel 
channel consists of two reaction regions, enabling the simultaneous analysis of 
multiple biomarkers in multiple samples. The presence of CEA and VEGF in the 
sample can be captured by the 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA)-conjugated antibody 
functionalized gold nano-sheet (GNS-) substrate, resulting in the Raman 
frequency shift. As a result, a typical Raman frequency shift of 4-MBA presented 
a linear relationship with the concentration of CEA and VEGF. The limit of 
detection (LOD) of the proposed SERS microfluidic chip reaches as low as 0.38 pg 
mL-1 for CEA and 0.82 pg mL-1 for VEGF. During the detection process, only one 
step of sample addition is involved, which eliminates the multiple reaction 
step-induced nonspecific adsorption and significantly increases the convenience 
and specificity. In addition, serum samples from GC patients and healthy 
subjects were tested and the results were in good agreement with the current 
gold-standard method ELISA, suggesting the potential application of the SERS 
microfluidic chip in clinical settings for early diagnosis and prognosis of GC.","DOI: 10.1039/d3an00535f

preservation in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Although anti-Müllerian 
hormone is used as a marker for ovarian reserve, serum levels do not always 
correlate with the number of follicles. Additionally, the follicle development 
stage most affected by chemotherapy is unclear. We examined the association 
between serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels and the number of remaining 
primordial follicles after chemotherapy, as well as which follicle stage is most 
affected by chemotherapy before ovarian cryopreservation.
METHODS: Thirty-three patients who underwent OTC were divided into the 
chemotherapy (n = 22) and non-chemotherapy (n = 11) groups; their ovarian 
tissues underwent histological examination. Pathological ovarian damage induced 
by chemotherapy was assessed. Ovarian volumes were estimated from weights. We 
compared the number of follicles at each developmental stage as a percentage of 
primordial follicles between the groups. The relationship between serum 
anti-Müllerian hormone level and primordial follicle density was analyzed.
RESULTS: The chemotherapy group had a significantly lower serum anti-Müllerian 
hormone level, ovarian volume, and density of developing follicles than the 
non-chemotherapy group. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels correlated with 
primordial follicle density only in the non-chemotherapy group. The chemotherapy 
group had significantly lower numbers of primary and secondary follicles.
CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy induces ovarian damage and follicle loss. However, 
serum anti-Müllerian hormone level does not always reflect the number of 
primordial follicles after chemotherapy, and chemotherapy more significantly 
affects primary and secondary follicles than primordial follicles. Many 
primordial follicles remain in the ovary after chemotherapy, supporting OTC for 
fertility preservation.",© 2023 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.,"DOI: 10.1111/jog.15718

medical need, because they are sparse in the therapeutic landscape of cancer 
treatment. Here, we report that IL-36 cytokine can engage both innate and

tumor cells but also promote T and NK cell responses. Thus, while poor

proteins propagate signals only when associated with cellular membranes as a 
consequence of lipid modifications that impact their trafficking. Here, we 
discovered that RAB27B, a RAB family small GTPase, controlled NRAS 
palmitoylation and trafficking to the plasma membrane, a localization required 
for activation. Our proteomic studies revealed RAB27B upregulation in CBL- or 
JAK2-mutated myeloid malignancies, and its expression correlated with poor 
prognosis in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). RAB27B depletion inhibited the 
growth of CBL-deficient or NRAS-mutant cell lines. Strikingly, Rab27b deficiency 
in mice abrogated mutant but not WT NRAS-mediated progenitor cell growth, ERK 
signaling, and NRAS palmitoylation. Further, Rab27b deficiency significantly 
reduced myelomonocytic leukemia development in vivo. Mechanistically, RAB27B 
interacted with ZDHHC9, a palmitoyl acyltransferase that modifies NRAS. By 
regulating palmitoylation, RAB27B controlled c-RAF/MEK/ERK signaling and 
affected leukemia development. Importantly, RAB27B depletion in primary human 
AMLs inhibited oncogenic NRAS signaling and leukemic growth. We further revealed 
a significant correlation between RAB27B expression and sensitivity to MEK

replanning by assessing the daily interfractional cervical and uterine motions 
using magnetic resonance (MR) images.
METHODS: Eleven patients with cervical cancer, who underwent intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT) in 23-25 fractions, were considered in this study. The daily 
and reference MR images were converted into three-dimensional (3D) shape models. 
Patient-specific anisotropic margins were calculated from the proximal 95% of 
vertices located outside the surface of the reference model. Population-based 
margins were defined as the 90th percentile values of the patient-specific 
margins. The expanded volume of interest (expVOI) for the cervix and uterus was 
generated by expanding the reference model based on the population-based margin 
to calculate the coverage for daily deformable mesh models. For comparison, 
expVOIconv was generated using conventional margins: right (R), left (L), 
anterior (A), posterior (P), superior (S), and inferior (I) were (5, 5, 15, 15, 
10, 10) and (10, 10, 20, 20, 15, 15) mm for the cervix and uterus, respectively. 
Subsequently, a replanning scenario was developed based on the cervical volume 
change. ExpVOIini and expVOIreplan were generated before and after replanning, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Population-based margins were (R, L, A, P, S, I) of (7, 7, 11, 6, 11, 
8) and (14, 13, 27, 19, 15, 21) mm for the cervix and uterus, respectively. The 
timing of replanning was found to be the 16th fraction, and the volume of 
expVOIreplan decreased by >30% compared to that of expVOIini . However, margins 
cannot be reduced to ensure equivalent coverage after replanning.
CONCLUSION: We determined the margins and timing of replanning through detailed 
daily analysis. The margins of the cervix were smaller than conventional margins 
in some directions, while the margins of the uterus were larger in almost all 
directions. A margin equivalent to that at the initial planning was required for 
replanning.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics published by

significantly over the past century, driven by increased understanding of the 
physiology of the reflux barrier, its anatomic components, and surgical 
innovation. Initially, emphasis was on reduction of hiatal hernias and crural 
closure as the etiology behind GERD was felt to be solely related to the 
anatomic alterations caused by hiatal hernias. With persistence of 
reflux-related changes in some patients despite crural closure, along with the 
development of what is now modern manometry and the discovery of a high-pressure 
zone at the distal esophagus, focus evolved to surgical augmentation of the 
lower esophageal sphincter (LES). With this transition to an LES-centric 
approach, attention shifted to reconstruction of the angle of His, ensuring 
sufficient intra-abdominal esophageal length, development of the now commonly 
employed Nissen fundoplication, and creation of devices that directly augment 
the LES such as magnetic sphincter augmentation. More recently, the role of 
crural closure in antireflux and hiatal hernia surgery has again received 
renewed attention due to the persistence of postoperative complications 
including wrap herniation and high rates of recurrences. Rather than simply 
preventing transthoracic herniation of the fundoplication as was originally 
thought, diaphragmatic crural closure has been documented to have a key role in 
re-establishing intra-abdominal esophageal length and contributing to the 
restoration of normal LES pressures. This progression from a crural-centric to a 
LES-centric approach and back has evolved along with our understanding of the 
reflux barrier and will continue to do so as more advances are made in the 
field. In this review, we will discuss the evolution of surgical techniques over 
the past century, highlighting key historical contributions that have shaped our 
management of GERD today.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of

provided a new angle for OC treatment. In this study, the cell proliferation and 
migration of ovarian cancer A2780/SKOV3 cells were inhibited after being treated 
with nitidine chloride (NC) by using MTT and Wound-Healing Assay. Flow cytometry 
analysis indicated NC-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells, and AO and MDC 
staining showed that NC treatment induced the appearance of autophagosomes and 
autophagic lysosomes in ovarian cancer cells. Through the autophagy inhibition 
experiment of chloroquine, it was proved that NC significantly further promoted 
apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, NC proved that it could 
significantly decrease the expression of autophagy-related genes such as Akt, 
mTOR, P85 S6K, P70 S6K, and 4E-BP1. Therefore, we suggest that NC could trigger 
autophagy and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells through Akt/mTOR signaling

development of vaccines, which is considered a medical advance in healthcare. 
With the extensive vaccination campaign performed worldwide, many adverse events 
following immunization (AEFI) were reported [1]. Most of them were flu-like 
symptoms, mild and self-limiting. However, serious adverse events, such as 
dermatomyositis (DM), an idiopathic autoimmune connective tissue disease, have 
also been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe a case of skin erythema, edema, 
and diffuse myalgia attributed at first to Pfizer BioNTeh, COVID-19 vaccination, 
given the temporal relationship and the absence of significant medical history. 
The causality assessment score was I1B2. However, after completing the 
etiological assessment, an invasive breast carcinoma was identified, and we 
retained the diagnosis of paraneoplastic DM.
CONCLUSION: This study underlines the importance of completing the etiological 
assessment before attributing any adverse reaction to vaccination to maintain 
optimal patient care.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

the colon or rectum of the digestive system. It is the second most commonly 
occurring form of cancer and ranks third in terms of mortality rate. The 
progression of CRC does not occur due to a single mutational event; rather, it 
is the result of the sequential and cumulative accumulation of mutations in key 
driver genes of signaling pathways. The most significant signaling pathways, 
which have oncogenic potential due to their deregulation, include Wnt/β-catenin, 
Notch, TGF-β, EGFR/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways. Numerous drug target therapies 
have been developed to treat CRC using small molecule inhibitors, antibodies, or 
peptides. Although drug-targeted therapy is effective in most cases, the 
development of resistance mechanisms in CRC has raised questions about their 
efficacy. To overcome this issue, a novel approach of to drug repurposing has 
come to light, which utilizes already FDA-approved drugs to treat CRC. This 
approach has shown some promising experimental results, making it a crucial 
avenue of research in the treatment of CRC.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

resulting in abnormal expansion of the cerebral ventricles. However, the 
underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. <P/> Materials and Methods: We 
performed proteomic analyses of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 7 congenital 
hydrocephalus and 5 arachnoid cyst patients who underwent surgical treatment. 
Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified by label-free Mass 
Spectrometry followed by differential expression analysis. The GO and GSEA 
enrichment analysis was performed to explore the cancer hallmark pathways and 
immune-related pathways affected by DEPs. Then, network analysis was applied to 
reveal the location of DEPs in the human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 
network. Potential drugs for hydrocephalus were identified based on drug-target 
interaction. <P/> Results: We identified 148 up-regulated proteins and 82 
down-regulated proteins, which are potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis 
of hydrocephalus and arachnoid cyst. Functional enrichment analysis revealed 
that the DEPs were significantly enriched in the cancer hallmark pathways and 
immune-related pathways. In addition, network analysis uncovered that DEPs were 
more likely to be located in the central regions of the human PPIs network, 
suggesting DEPs may be proteins that play important roles in human PPIs. 
Finally, we calculated the overlap of drug targets and the DEPs based on 
drug-target interaction to identify the potential therapeutic drugs of 
hydrocephalus. <P/> Conclusion: The comprehensive proteomic analyses provided 
valuable resources for investigating the molecular pathways in hydrocephalus, 
and uncovered potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and therapy.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

positive Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and BCR-ABL negative MPNs including 
Polycythemia vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary myelofibrosis 
(PMF). Evaluation of the Philadelphia chromosome in MPNs is a diagnostic 
requirement for classic CML.
CASE REPORT: In 2020, a 37-year-old woman with negative cytogenetic testing for 
Janus kinase2 (JAK2), Calreticulin (CALR), myeloproliferative leukemia virus 
oncogene (MPL), and positive for BCR-ABL1 mutation with reticular fibrosis in 
bone marrow was diagnosed as CML. Some years ago, the patient had been diagnosed 
with PMF with evidence of histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis or 
Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). The BCR-ABL fusion gene was initially evaluated 
which was negative. Then, Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) was confirmed 
by Dermatopathologist with palpable splenomegaly and high white blood cell (WBC) 
count with basophilia. Finally, BCR-ABL was detected positive by the 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In fact, the co-occurrence of PMF with CML was 
identified.
CONCLUSION: This case study highlighted the importance of some cytogenetic 
methods in the detection and classification of MPNs. It is recommended that 
physicians pay more attention to it and be aware of the planning treatment.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) exposure for human. As a potent carcinogen, NDMA 
was frequently detected in roasted Alaska pollock fillet products (RPFs) which 
is among the most common fish products in China. Until now, the occurrence and 
development of NDMA and its precursors (nitrites, nitrates and dimethylamine) in 
RPFs during processing and storage were not well elucidated, and safety 
evaluation of this fish product is also urgently needed.
RESULTS: The presence of precursors in the raw material was verified and 
significant increase of nitrates and nitrites during processing was observed. 
NDMA was found generated during pre-drying (3.7μg/kg dry basis) and roasting 
(14.6μg/kg dry basis) process. Continuous increase in NDMA content can also be 
found during storage, especially at higher storage temperature. The 95th 
percentile of Monte Carlo simulated cancer risk (3.73E-5) surpassed the WHO 
threshold (1.00E-5) and sensitivity analysis implies the risk was mainly 
attributable to NDMA level in RPFs.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of NDMA in RFPs was mainly due to endogenous factors 
originated in Alaska pollock during processing and storage rather than exogenous 
contamination, and temperature played a pivotal role. The preliminary risk 
assessment results suggest that long-term consumption of RPFs would impose 
potential health risks for consumers. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: This study included 48 bladder cancer (BC) and 67 upper tract 
urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients treated with pembrolizumab from December 
2017 to September 2022 at Kobe University Hospital. Medical records were 
retrospectively reviewed for clinical characteristics, objective response rate 
(ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Multivariate 
analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model to 
identify parameters associated with either PFS or OS.
RESULTS: Of 67 UTUC patients, 23 had RPI and 41 patients did not, while 3 cases 
could not be evaluated. Patients with RPI were predominantly elderly and had 
liver metastases. ORR for patients with RPI was 8.7%, while it was 19.5% for 
those without RPI. PFS was significantly shorter for patients with RPI compared 
with those without RPI. Patients with RPI had significantly shorter OS than 
those without RPI. On multivariate analysis, performance status (PS) ≥ 2, 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥ 3, C-reactive protein ≥0.3 mg/dL and RPI 
were independent prognostic factors for PFS. PS ≥ 2, NLR ≥ 3, visceral

was significantly shorter than BC patient OS, while no significant difference in

regional spread of lung cancer with different levels of potential lymph node 
involvement and tumor size that often deem the stage at time of diagnosis to be 
unresectable and suitable for chemoradiation plus consolidation immunotherapy 
with durvalumab for 12 months. Chemoradiation plus durvalumab consolidation 
yielded a landmark 49.2% 5-year overall survival in unresectable NSCLC.
AREAS COVERED: Sub-optimal results lead us to focus on the mechanisms of 
resistance responsible for intractability in a significant proportion of cases 
that fail with chemoradiation and immunotherapy. In stage III NSCLC it is 
opportune to explore the accumulated evidence on ferroptosis resistance that can 
lead to cancer progression and metastasis. Strong data shows that three 
anti-ferroptosis pathways are principally involved in resistance to 
chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy.
EXPERT OPINION: Because a large part of stage III NSCLCs is resistant to 
chemoradiation and durvalumab consolidation, a ferroptosis-based therapeutic 
approach, combined with standard-of-care therapy, can lead to improved clinical 
outcomes in patients diagnosed with stage III and possibly stage IV NSCLCs.","DOI: 10.1080/17476348.2023.2223985

challenging. Currently there is no effective treatment for refractory AML. 
Increasing evidence has demonstrated that refractory/relapsed AML is associated 
with leukemic blasts which can confer resistance to anticancer drugs. We have 
previously reported that high expression of Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4) 
is associated with increased cancer activity in AML. However, the functional 
role of FLT4 in leukemic blasts remains unknown. Here, we explored the 
significance of FLT4 expression in leukemic blasts of refractory patients and 
mechanisms involved in the survival of AML blasts. Inhibition or absence of FLT4 
in AML-blasts suppressed homing to bone marrow (BM) of immunocompromised mice 
and blocked engraftment of AML blasts. Moreover, FLT4 inhibition by MAZ51, an 
antagonist, effectively reduced the number of leukemic cell-derived 
colonyforming units and increased apoptosis of blasts derived from refractory 
patients when it was cotreated with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) under VEGF-C, 
its ligand. AML patients who expressed high cytosolic FLT4 were linked to an 
AML-refractory status by internalization mechanism. In conclusion, FLT4 has a 
biological function in leukemogenesis and refractoriness. This novel insight 
will be useful for targeted therapy and prognostic stratification of AML.","DOI: 10.3324/haematol.2022.282472

outcome, such as AML with translocation t(7;12)(q36;p13) leading to a MNX1::ETV6 
fusion along with high expression of MNX1. We have identified the transforming 
event in this AML and possible ways of treatment. Retroviral expression of MNX1 
was able to induce AML in mice, with similar gene expression and pathway 
enrichment to t(7;12) AML patient data. Importantly, this leukemia was only 
induced in immune incompetent mice using fetal but not adult hematopoietic stem 
and progenitor cells. The restriction in transforming capacity to cells from 
fetal liver is in alignment with t(7;12)(q36;p13) AML being mostly seen in 
infants. Expression of MNX1 led to increased histone 3 lysine 4 mono-, di- and 
trimethylation, reduction in H3K27me3, accompanied with changes in genome-wide 
chromatin accessibility and genome expression, likely mediated through MNX1 
interaction with the methionine cycle and methyltransferases. MNX1 expression 
increased DNA damage, depletion of the Lin- /Sca1+/c-Kit+ population and skewing 
toward the myeloid lineage. These effects, together with leukemia development, 
was prevented by pretreatment with the S-adenosylmethionine analog Sinefungin. 
In conclusion, we have shown the importance of MNX1 in development of AML with 
t(7;12), supporting a rationale for targeting MNX1 and downstream pathways.","DOI: 10.3324/haematol.2022.282255

county-level poverty with postoperative outcomes.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The impact of long-standing poverty on surgical 
outcomes remains ill-defined.
METHODS: Patients who underwent lung resection, colectomy, coronary artery 
bypass graft (CABG), or lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) were identified 
from Medicare Standard Analytical Files Database (2015-2017) and merged with 
data from the American Community Survey and United States Department of 
Agriculture. Patients were categorized according to duration of high poverty 
status from 1980-2015 (i.e., never high poverty [NHP], persistent poverty [PP]). 
Logistic regression was used to characterize the association between duration of 
poverty and postoperative outcomes. Principal component and generalized 
structural equation modeling were used to assess the effect of mediators in 
achievement of textbook outcomes (TO).
RESULTS: Overall, 335,595 patients underwent lung resection (10.1%), colectomy 
(29.4%), CABG (36.4%) or LEJR (24.2%). While 80.3% of patients lived in NHP, 
4.4% resided in PP counties. Compared with NHP, patients residing in PP were at 
increased risk of serious postoperative complications (OR=1.10, 95%CI 
1.05-1.15), 30-day readmission (OR=1.09, 95%CI 1.01-1.16), 30-day mortality 
(OR=1.08, 95%CI 1.00-1.17) and higher expenditures (mean difference, $1,010.0, 
95%CI 643.7-1376.4)(all P<0.05). Notably, PP was associated with lower odds of 
achieving TO (OR=0.93, 95%CI 0.90-0.97, P<0.001); 65% of this effect was 
mediated by other social determinant factors. Minority patients were less likely 
to achieve TO (OR=0.81, 95%CI 0.79-0.84, P<0.001), and the disparity persisted 
across all poverty categories.
CONCLUSIONS: County-level poverty duration was associated with adverse 
postoperative outcomes and higher expenditures. These effects were mediated by 
various socioeconomic factors and were most pronounced among minority patients.","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005953

apoptotic pathways and could potentially be used in anticancer treatments. 
However, oral squamous cell carcinoma cells are known to be resistant to tumor 
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced cell death. It has 
been previously reported that hyperthermia upregulates tumor necrosis 
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in other cancers. As 
such, we evaluated whether hyperthermia upregulates tumor necrosis 
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-mediated apoptosis in a tumor necrosis 
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-resistant oral squamous cell carcinoma 
cell line.
METHODS: The oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC3 was cultured and 
divided into hyperthermia and control groups. We investigated the antitumor 
effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand using cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Additionally, we measured 
death receptor 4 and 5 levels, and determined death receptor ubiquitination 
status, as well as E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting of death receptor in both 
hyperthermia and control groups before recombinant human tumor necrosis 
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand administration.
RESULTS: Treatment with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand produced greater inhibitory effects in the 
hyperthermia group than in the control group. Moreover, death receptor protein 
expression in the hyperthermia group was upregulated on the cell surface (and 
overall), although death receptor mRNA was downregulated. The half-life of death 
receptor was several hours longer in the hyperthermia group; concomitantly, E3 
ubiquitin ligase expression and death receptor ubiquitination were downregulated 
in this group.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that hyperthermia enhances apoptotic 
signaling by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand via the 
suppression of death receptor ubiquitination, which upregulates death receptor 
expression. These data suggest that the combination of hyperthermia and tumor 
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand has implications in developing 
a novel treatment strategy for oral squamous cell carcinoma.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/jop.13457

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are approved for multiple 
cancers but can result in ICI-associated myocarditis, an infrequent but 
life-threatening condition. Elevations in cardiac biomarkers, specifically 
troponin-I (cTnI), troponin-T (cTnT), and creatine kinase (CK), are used for 
diagnosis. However, the association between temporal elevations of these 
biomarkers with disease trajectory and outcomes has not been established.
METHODS: We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic performances of 
cTnI, cTnT, and CK in patients with ICI myocarditis (n=60) through 1-year 
follow-up in 2 cardio-oncology units (APHP Sorbonne: Paris, France and 
Heidelberg, Germany). A total of 1751 (1 cTnT assay type), 920 (4 cTnI assay 
types), and 1191 CK sampling time points were available. Major adverse 
cardiomyotoxic events (MACE) were defined as heart failure, ventricular 
arrhythmia, atrioventricular or sinus block requiring pacemaker, respiratory 
muscle failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and sudden cardiac death. 
Diagnostic performance of cTnI and cTnT was also assessed in an international 
ICI myocarditis registry.
RESULTS: Within 72 hours of admission, cTnT, cTnI, and CK were increased 
compared with upper reference limits (URLs) in 56 of 57 (98%), 37 of 42 ([88%] 
P=0.03 versus cTnT), and 43 of 57 ([75%] P<0.001 versus cTnT), respectively. 
This increased rate of positivity for cTnT (93%) versus cTnI ([64%] P<0.001) on 
admission was confirmed in 87 independent cases from an international registry 
comprising 13 countries. In the Franco-German cohort, 24 of 60 (40%) patients 
developed ≥1 MACE (total, 52; median time to first MACE, 5 [interquartile range, 
2-16] days). The highest value of cTnT:URL within the first 72 hours of 
admission performed best in terms of association with MACE within 90 days (area 
under the curve, 0.84) than CK:URL (area under the curve, 0.70). A cTnT:URL ≥32 
within 72 hours of admission was the best cut-off associated with MACE within 90 
days (hazard ratio, 11.1 [95% CI, 3.2-38.0]; P<0.001), after adjustment for age 
and sex. cTnT was increased in all patients within 72 hours of the first MACE 
(23 of 23 [100%]), whereas cTnI and CK values were less than the URL in 2 of 19 
(11%) and 6 of 22 (27%) of patients (P<0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: cTnT is associated with MACE and is sensitive for diagnosis and 
surveillance in patients with ICI myocarditis. A cTnT:URL ratio <32 within 72 
hours of diagnosis is associated with a subgroup at low risk for MACE. Potential 
differences in diagnostic and prognostic performances between cTnT and cTnI as a 
function of the assays used deserve further evaluation in ICI myocarditis.","DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.062405

and CLIC4 are required for the GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) S1PR1 
(sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1) and S1PR3 to activate the small GTPases 
Rac1 and RhoA. To determine whether CLIC1 and CLIC4 function in additional 
endothelial GPCR pathways, we evaluated CLIC function in thrombin signaling via 
the thrombin-regulated PAR1 (protease-activated receptor 1) and downstream 
effector RhoA.
METHODS: We assessed the ability of CLIC1 and CLIC4 to relocalize to cell 
membranes in response to thrombin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVEC). We examined CLIC1 and CLIC4 function in HUVEC by knocking down 
expression of each CLIC protein and compared thrombin-mediated RhoA or Rac1 
activation, ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) phosphorylation, and endothelial barrier 
modulation in control and CLIC knockdown HUVEC. We generated a conditional 
murine allele of Clic4 and examined PAR1-mediated lung microvascular 
permeability and retinal angiogenesis in mice with endothelial-specific loss of 
Clic4.
RESULTS: Thrombin promoted relocalization of CLIC4, but not CLIC1, to HUVEC 
membranes. Knockdown of CLIC4 in HUVEC reduced thrombin-mediated RhoA 
activation, ERM phosphorylation, and endothelial barrier disruption. Knockdown 
of CLIC1 did not reduce thrombin-mediated RhoA activity but prolonged the RhoA 
and endothelial barrier response to thrombin. Endothelial-specific deletion of 
Clic4 in mice reduced lung edema and microvascular permeability induced by PAR1 
activating peptide.
CONCLUSIONS: CLIC4 is a critical effector of endothelial PAR1 signaling and is 
required to regulate RhoA-mediated endothelial barrier disruption in cultured 
endothelial cells and murine lung endothelium. CLIC1 was not critical for 
thrombin-mediated barrier disruption but contributed to the barrier recovery 
phase after thrombin treatment.","DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.319206

destabilize interactions between adjacent vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to 
facilitate the passage of immune molecules and cells into tissues. However, in 
the lung, the resulting vascular hyperpermeability can lead to organ 
dysfunction. Previous work identified the transcription factor ERG (erythroblast 
transformation-specific-related gene) as a master regulator of endothelial 
homeostasis. Here we investigate whether the sensitivity of pulmonary blood 
vessels to cytokine-induced destabilization is due to organotypic mechanisms 
affecting the ability of endothelial ERG to protect lung ECs from inflammatory 
injury.
METHODS: Cytokine-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ERG 
were analyzed in cultured human umbilical vein ECs. Systemic administration of 
TNFα (tumor necrosis factor alpha) or the bacterial cell wall component 
lipopolysaccharide was used to cause a widespread inflammatory challenge in 
mice; ERG protein levels were assessed by immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and 
immunofluorescence. Murine Erg deletion was genetically induced in ECs 
(Ergfl/fl;Cdh5[PAC]-CreERT2), and multiple organs were analyzed by histology, 
immunostaining, and electron microscopy.
RESULTS: In vitro, TNFα promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of ERG in 
human umbilical vein ECs, which was blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. 
In vivo, systemic administration of TNFα or lipopolysaccharide resulted in a 
rapid and substantial degradation of ERG within lung ECs but not ECs of the 
retina, heart, liver, or kidney. Pulmonary ERG was also downregulated in a 
murine model of influenza infection. Ergfl/fl;Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 mice 
spontaneously recapitulated aspects of inflammatory challenges, including 
lung-predominant vascular hyperpermeability, immune cell recruitment, and 
fibrosis. These phenotypes were associated with a lung-specific decrease in the 
expression of Tek-a gene target of ERG previously implicated in maintaining 
pulmonary vascular stability during inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data highlight a unique role for ERG in pulmonary 
vascular function. We propose that cytokine-induced ERG degradation and 
subsequent transcriptional changes in lung ECs play critical roles in the 
destabilization of pulmonary blood vessels during infectious diseases.","DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.318926

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Vascular growth followed by vessel specification is crucial for the 
establishment of a hierarchical blood vascular network. We have shown that TIE2 
is required for vein development while little is known about its homologue TIE1 
(tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1) in this 
process.
METHODS: We analyzed functions of TIE1 as well as its synergy with TIE2 in the 
regulation of vein formation by employing genetic mouse models targeting Tie1, 
Tek, and Nr2f2, together with in vitro cultured endothelial cells to decipher 
the underlying mechanism.
RESULTS: Cardinal vein growth appeared normal in TIE1-deficient mice, whereas 
TIE2 deficiency altered the identity of cardinal vein endothelial cells with the 
aberrant expression of DLL4. Interestingly, the growth of cutaneous veins, which 
was initiated at approximately embryonic day 13.5, was retarded in mice lack of 
TIE1. TIE1 deficiency disrupted the venous integrity, displaying increased 
sprouting angiogenesis and vascular bleeding. Abnormal venous sprouts with 
defective arteriovenous alignment were also observed in the mesenteries of 
Tie1-deleted mice. Mechanistically, TIE1 deficiency resulted in the decreased 
expression of venous regulators including TIE2 and COUP-TFII (chicken ovalbumin 
upstream promoter transcription factor, encoded by Nr2f2, nuclear receptor 
subfamily 2 group F member 2) while angiogenic regulators were upregulated. The 
alteration of TIE2 level by TIE1 insufficiency was further confirmed by the 
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Tie1 in cultured endothelial cells. Interestingly, 
TIE2 insufficiency also reduced the expression of TIE1. Combining the 
endothelial deletion of Tie1 with 1 null allele of Tek resulted in a progressive 
increase of vein-associated angiogenesis leading to the formation of vascular 
tufts in retinas, whereas the loss of Tie1 alone produced a relatively mild 
venous defect. Furthermore, the induced deletion of endothelial Nr2f2 decreased 
both TIE1 and TIE2.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study imply that TIE1 and TIE2, together with 
COUP-TFII, act in a synergistic manner to restrict sprouting angiogenesis during 
the development of venous system.","DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.318860

exclusively seen in conus medullaris or filum terminale. MPE can be 
diagnostically challenging, especially when arising extra-axially. Here we 
report 5 cases of superficial soft tissue/cutaneous MPE, identified across three 
tertiary institutions. All patients were female and three of them (3/5, 60%) 
were children (median age 11 years, range 6-58 years). The tumors presented as 
slow-growing masses of the sacrococcygeal subcutaneous soft tissues, 
occasionally identified after minor trauma and clinically favored to be 
pilonidal sinuses. Imaging showed no neuraxis connection. Macroscopically, 
tumors were well-circumscribed, lobulated, and solid and microscopically they 
exhibited typical histopathology of MPE, at least focally. Two of the tumors 
(2/5, 40%) showed predominantly solid or trabecular architecture with greater 
cellular pleomorphism, scattered giant cells, and increased mitotic activity. 
All tumors (5/5, 100%) showed strong diffuse immunohistochemical expression of 
GFAP. One tumor clustered at the category ""ependymoma, myxopapillary"" by 
methylome analysis. Two patients (2/5, 40%) had local recurrence at 8 and 
30 months after the initial surgery. No patients developed metastases during the 
follow-up period (median 60 months, range 6-116 months). Since a subset of 
extra-axial MPEs behaves more aggressively, timely and accurate diagnosis is of 
paramount importance.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/cup.14475

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVES: A single dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine would simplify 
logistics and reduce costs of vaccination programs worldwide. We conducted a 
phase IIa trial to determine the stability of HPV type-specific antibody 
responses after a single dose of the nonavalent HPV vaccine, Gardasil9.
METHODS: Two hundred-and-one healthy 9 to 11-year-old girls and boys were 
enrolled at 2 centers in the United States to receive a prime dose of the 
nonavalent vaccine at baseline, a delayed dose at month 24, and an optional 
third dose at month 30. Blood samples were collected to measure HPV 
type-specific antibodies at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after 
the prime dose. The primary outcomes were serum HPV16 and HPV18 antibody 
responses.
RESULTS: In both girls and boys, geometric mean concentrations of HPV16 and 
HPV18 antibodies increased at 6 months, declined between months 6 to 12, and 
then remained stable and high (at 20- and 10-times those at baseline for HPV16 
and HPV18, respectively) throughout months 12, 18, and 24 (prebooster) visits. 
Both HPV16 and HPV18 antibody responses demonstrated anamnestic boosting effect 
at 30-months after the delayed (24-month) booster dose.
CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of the nonavalent HPV vaccine induced persistent and 
stable HPV16 and HPV18 antibody responses up to 24 months. This study 
contributes important immunogenicity data to inform feasibility of the single 
dose HPV vaccination paradigm. Further research is needed to assess the 
long-term antibody stability and individual clinical and public health benefit

Asian patients as compared to Caucasians. Few studies have analysed the overall 
survival rate (OS) and melanoma-specific survival rate (MSS) of patients with 
cutaneous malignant melanoma in South Korea. Aim This study aims to analyse the 
OS, MSS and prognostic factors of patients with invasive cutaneous malignant 
melanoma in South Korea. Methods The medical records of patients diagnosed with 
invasive cutaneous malignant melanoma from July 2006 to June 2016 at Kyungpook 
National University Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. The OS/MSS of these 
patients were calculated in accordance with the Eighth American Joint Committee 
on Center staging system and the prognostic factors affecting MSS were analysed. 
Results A total of 202 patients with a mean age of 61.5 years were included. The 
5-year OS/MSS was 64.4%/70.7% in the patients. The 5-year OS/MSS was 94.7%/97.1% 
for stage I, 67.2%/76.3% for stage II, 54.4%/59.1% for stage III, and 0%/0% for 
stage IV. On univariate analysis, the age, sex, Breslow thickness, ulceration, 
microsatellites, satellites, locally recurrent or in-transit metastasis, tumour 
metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes and clinicopathological stage were all 
significantly associated with the MSS, but not with acral distribution or BRAF 
mutation status. However, on multivariate analysis only the Breslow thickness, 
ulceration and stage IV were significantly associated with the MSS. Limitations 
This study was conducted retrospectively in a relatively small number of 
patients at a single tertiary center in South Korea. Conclusions The OS/MSS of 
patients with invasive cutaneous malignant melanoma in South Korea was lower 
than those in Caucasians. In addition to the Breslow thickness and ulceration, 
the impact of tumour location and sentinel nodal metastasis on cutaneous 
malignant melanoma should be reevaluated to better understand the disease 
prognosis in these patients.","DOI: 10.25259/IJDVL_352_2022

treatment modes to improve the antitumor efficacy. Also, multifunctional probes 
are crucial to realize synergistic therapy. Herein, a multifunctional DNA 
tetrahedron nanoprobe was ingeniously designed to simultaneously achieve 
chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and gene silencing for synergistic antitumor. The 
multifunctional DNA tetrahedron nanoprobe, DNA tetrahedron-silver 
nanocluster-antagomir-21 (D-sgc8-DTNS-AgNCs-Anta-21), integrated a CDT reagent 
(DNA-AgNCs) and miRNA-21 inhibitor (Anta-21) with a specific recognition probe 
(aptamer). After targeted entry in cancer cells, D-sgc8-DTNS-AgNCs-Anta-21 
silenced endogenous miRNA-21 by Anta-21 and produced highly toxic ˙OH by 
reacting with H2O2, which induced apoptosis in the tumor cells. The targeted 
recognition of aptamers led to the concentration-dependent death of HeLa cells. 
On the contrary, the cell survival rate of normal cells was basically unaffected 
with an increase in the concentration of D-sgc8-DTNS-AgNCs-Anta-21. Therefore, 
the diverse functions, biocompatibility and programmability of DNA provide a 
useful and easy way to assemble multifunctional probes for synergistic therapy.","DOI: 10.1039/d2nh00575a

as 1 day after following this protocol. Proliferating cells were traced in the 
rim, while dead cells were found to be located inside the core region of the 
spheroid using confocal microscopy and the Incucyte® live imaging system. H&E 
staining of spheroid sections was utilized to investigate the tightness of the 
cell packaging. Through western blotting analyses, it was revealed that a stem 
cell-like phenotype was adopted by these spheroids. This method was also used to 
obtain the EC50 of the anticancer dipeptide carnosine on U87 MG 3D culture. This

a barrier to shared decision-making and well-being. This study aimed to evaluate 
the impact of written educational materials on breast cancer patients.
METHODS: This multicenter, parallel, unblinded, randomized trial included Latin 
American women aged ≥18 years with a recent breast cancer diagnosis yet to start 
systemic therapy. Participants underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
a customizable or standard educational brochure. The primary objective was 
accurate identification of molecular subtype. Secondary objectives included 
identification of clinical stage, treatment options, participation in 
decision-making, perceived quality of information received, and illness 
uncertainty. Follow-up occurred at 7-21 and 30-51 days post-randomization.
CLINICALTRIALS: gov identifier: NCT05798312.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five breast cancer patients with a median age of 
53 years and 61 days from diagnosis were included (customizable: 82; standard: 
83). At first available assessment, 52%, 48%, and 30% identified their molecular 
subtype, disease stage, and guideline-endorsed systemic treatment strategy, 
respectively. Accurate molecular subtype and stage identification were similar 
between groups. Per multivariate analysis, customizable brochure recipients were 
more likely to identify their guideline-recommended treatment modalities (OR: 
4.20,p = 0.001). There were no differences between groups in the perceived 
quality of information received or illness uncertainty. Customizable brochure 
recipients reported increased participation in decision-making (p = 0.042).
CONCLUSIONS: Over one third of recently diagnosed breast cancer patients are 
incognizant of their disease characteristics and treatment options. This study 
demonstrates a need to improve patient education and shows that customizable 
educational materials increase patients' understanding of recommended systemic 
therapies according to individual breast cancer characteristics.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6215

in Toll-like receptor (TLR) 8-mediated regulation of glucose metabolism and its 
effect on reversing immunosuppression in CD4+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in 
ovarian cancer (OC).
METHODS: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to detect the expression 
levels of mTOR+ and 4E-BP1+ cells in CD4+ Tregs. The prognosis and immune 
infiltration analysis of mTOR mRNA in OC were performed using the TIMER and 
Kaplan-Meier plotter database. Furthermore, real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and western blot (WB) were used to detect expression levels of glucose 
metabolism-related genes and proteins in CD4+ Tregs. Glucose uptake and 
glycolysis levels were detected by colorimetry, while the effects of CD4+ Tregs 
on the proliferation of CD4+ T-effector cells (Teffs) were evaluated by 
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE).
RESULTS: mTOR expression in CD4+ Tregs was significantly higher in patients with 
OC compared with controls and in CD4+ Tregs than in CD4+ Teffs in OC. 
Additionally, the expression level of mTOR mRNA was related to prognosis and 
immune infiltration levels in patients with OC. Blocking the mTOR signal 
resulted in downregulation of glucose metabolism in CD4+ Tregs. Simultaneous 
inhibition of the mTOR signal while activation of the TLR8 signal had a 
coordinated inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism and the immunosuppressive 
function of CD4+ Tregs. Furthermore, the mTOR signal played an essential role in 
TLR8-mediated reversal of immunosuppressive function in CD4+ Tregs.
CONCLUSION: These findings imply that activation of the TLR8 signal inhibits 
glucose metabolism in CD4+ Tregs by downregulating mTOR signaling, thereby 
reversing the immunosuppressive function of these cells in an OC cell growth 
environment.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6247

cancer patients. However, the prognostic impact of specific PAs is not well 
understood. Therefore, we investigated the associations of the duration, type, 
intensity, and number of PAs one participates in pre- and post-diagnosis with 
mortality in Korean patients with cancer.
METHODS: Among the participants aged 40-69 years recruited from the Health 
Examines study, those diagnosed with cancer after baseline (n = 7749) and within 
10 years before baseline (n = 3008) were included in the analyses for pre- and 
post-diagnosis PA, respectively. Duration, intensity, type, and number of 
leisure-time physical activities participated in were assessed using 
questionnaires. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to characterize the 
association between PA and cancer-specific mortality, adjusting for 
demographics, behaviors, comorbidities, and cancer stage based on the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program.
RESULTS: Pre-diagnosis, patients participating in vigorous-intensity activities 
(hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.82), walking (HR: 
0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97), climbing (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.55-0.77), sports (HR: 
0.39, 95% CI: 0.25-0.61), and more than two activities (HR: 0.73, 95% CI:

worldwide each year. Typically, DTC is a treatable disease with a good 
prognosis. Yet, some patients are subjected to partial or total thyroidectomy 
and radioiodine therapy to prevent local disease recurrence and metastasis. 
Unfortunately, thyroidectomy and/or radioiodine therapy often worsen(s) quality 
of life and might be unnecessary in indolent DTC cases. On the other hand, the 
lack of biomarkers indicating a potential metastatic thyroid cancer imposes an 
additional challenge to managing and treating patients with this disease.
AIM: The presented clinical setting highlights the unmet need for a precise 
molecular diagnosis of DTC and potential metastatic disease, which should 
dictate appropriate therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article, we present a differential multi-omics 
model approach, including metabolomics, genomics, and bioinformatic models, to 
distinguish normal glands from thyroid tumours. Additionally, we are proposing 
biomarkers that could indicate potential metastatic diseases in papillary 
thyroid cancer (PTC), a sub-class of DTC.
RESULTS: Normal and tumour thyroid tissue from DTC patients had a distinct yet 
well-defined metabolic profile with high levels of anabolic metabolites and/or 
other metabolites associated with the energy maintenance of tumour cells. The 
consistency of the DTC metabolic profile allowed us to build a bioinformatic 
classification model capable of clearly distinguishing normal from tumor thyroid 
tissues, which might help diagnose thyroid cancer. Moreover, based on PTC 
patient samples, our data suggest that elevated nuclear and mitochondrial DNA 
mutational burden, intra-tumour heterogeneity, shortened telomere length, and 
altered metabolic profile reflect the potential for metastatic disease.
DISCUSSION: Altogether, this work indicates that a differential and integrated 
multi-omics approach might improve DTC management, perhaps preventing 
unnecessary thyroid gland removal and/or radioiodine therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed, prospective translational clinical trials will 
ultimately show the value of this integrated multi-omics approach and early 
diagnosis of DTC and potential metastatic PTC.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical and Translational Medicine published by John Wiley

survivors (YACS) have focused on short-term outcomes without evaluating 
longer-term outcomes and PA maintenance. This study examined the effects of an 
mHealth PA intervention at 12 months, after 6 months of tapered contacts, 
relative to a self-help group among 280 YACS.
METHODS: YACS participated in a 12-month randomized trial that compared 
self-help and intervention groups. All participants received an activity 
tracker, smart scale, individual videochat session, and access to a 
condition-specific Facebook group. Intervention participants also received 
lessons, tailored feedback, adaptive goal setting, text messages, and Facebook 
prompts for 6 months, followed by tapered contacts. Accelerometer-measured and 
self-reported PA (total [primary outcome], moderate-to-vigorous [MVPA], light, 
steps, sedentary behaviors) were collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. 
Generalized estimating equation analyses evaluated group effects on outcomes 
from baseline to 12 months.
RESULTS: From baseline to 12 months, there were no between- or within-group 
differences in accelerometer-measured total PA min/week, while increases in 
self-reported total PA were greater in the intervention versus self-help group 
(mean difference = +55.8 min/week [95% CI, 6.0-105.6], p = 0.028). Over 
12 months, both groups increased accelerometer-measured MVPA (intervention: 
+22.5 min/week [95% CI, 8.8-36.2] vs. self-help: +13.9 min/week [95% CI, 
3.0-24.9]; p = 0.34), with no between-group differences. Both groups maintained 
accelerometer-measured and self-reported PA (total, MVPA) from 6 to 12 months. 
At 12 months, more intervention participants reported meeting national PA 
guidelines than self-help participants (47.9% vs. 33.1%, RR = 1.45, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: The intervention was not more effective than the self-help group at 
increasing accelerometer-measured total PA over 12 months. Both groups 
maintained PA from 6 to 12 months. Digital approaches have potential for 
promoting sustained PA participation in YACS, but additional research is needed 
to identify what strategies work for whom, and under what conditions.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6238

of transcription to initiate and maintain long-term silencing. The mechanisms by 
which these heterochromatic genome features are transcribed remain largely 
unknown. Here, we show that DOT1L, a conserved histone methyltransferase that 
modifies lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79), has a specialized role in 
transcription of major satellite repeats to maintain pericentromeric 
heterochromatin and genome stability. We find that H3K79me3 is selectively 
enriched relative to H3K79me2 at repetitive elements in mouse embryonic stem 
cells (mESCs), that DOT1L loss compromises pericentromeric satellite 
transcription, and that this activity involves possible coordination between 
DOT1L and the chromatin remodeler SMARCA5. Stimulation of transcript production 
from pericentromeric repeats by DOT1L participates in stabilization of 
heterochromatin structures in mESCs and cleavage-stage embryos and is required 
for preimplantation viability. Our findings uncover an important role for DOT1L 
as a bridge between transcriptional activation of repeat elements and 
heterochromatin stability, advancing our understanding of how genome integrity 
is maintained and how chromatin state is set up during early development.",© 2023 The Authors.,"DOI: 10.15252/embr.202256492

chromatin structure. The accessibility of transcriptional elements in DNA is 
controlled by the dynamic structural changes of chromatin for the appropriate 
regulation of gene transcription. Chromatin structure is regulated by two 
general mechanisms, one is histone modification and the other is chromatin 
remodeling in an ATP-dependent manner. Switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) 
complexes utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to mobilize nucleosomes and 
remodel the chromatin structure, contributing to conformational changes in 
chromatin. Recently, the inactivation of encoding genes for subunits of the 
SWI/SNF complexes has been documented in a series of human cancers, accounting 
for up to almost 20% of all human cancers. For example, human SNF5 (hSNF5), the 
gene that encodes a subunit of the SWI/SNF complexes, is the sole mutation 
target that drives malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT). Despite remarkably simple 
genomes, the MRT has highly malignant characteristics. As a key to understanding 
MRT tumorigenesis, it is necessary to fully examine the mechanism of chromatin 
remodeling by the SWI/SNF complexes. Herein, we review the current understanding 
of chromatin remodeling by focusing on SWI/SNF complexes. In addition, we 
describe the molecular mechanisms and influences of hSNF5 deficiency in rhabdoid 
tumors and the prospects for developing new therapeutic targets to overcome the 
epigenetic drive of cancer that is caused by abnormal chromatin remodeling.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6255

microvascular images from multi-b-value diffusion MRI data by using a 
physics-informed neural network (PINN) fitting approach.
METHODS: Test-retest whole-brain inversion recovery diffusion-weighted images 
with multiple b-values (IVIM: intravoxel incoherent motion) were acquired on 
separate days for 16 patients with cerebrovascular disease on a 3.0T MRI system. 
The performance of the PINN three-component IVIM (3C-IVIM) model fitting 
approach was compared with conventional fitting approaches (i.e., non-negative 
least squares and two-step least squares) in terms of (1) parameter map quality, 
(2) test-retest repeatability, and (3) voxel-wise accuracy. Using the in vivo 
data, the parameter map quality was assessed by the parameter contrast-to-noise 
ratio (PCNR) between normal-appearing white matter and white matter 
hyperintensities, and test-retest repeatability was expressed by the coefficient 
of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The voxel-wise 
accuracy of the 3C-IVIM parameters was determined by 10,000 computer simulations 
mimicking our in vivo data. Differences in PCNR and CV values obtained with the 
PINN approach versus conventional fitting approaches were assessed using paired 
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
RESULTS: The PINN-derived 3C-IVIM parameter maps were of higher quality and more 
repeatable than those of conventional fitting approaches, while also achieving 
higher voxel-wise accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Physics-informed neural networks enable robust voxel-wise estimation 
of three diffusion components from the diffusion-weighted signal. The repeatable 
and high-quality biological parameter maps generated with PINNs allow for visual 
evaluation of pathophysiological processes in cerebrovascular disease.","© 2023 The Authors. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley

bone metastases during the COVID-19 pandemic became challenging. A simple 
technique, single fraction radiotherapy was recommended for these patients 
usually referring to bone metastases as a single entity, although it is a very 
heterogeneous group of patients.
AIM: This study aimed to analyze the response to palliative single fraction 
radiotherapy in relation to age, performance status, primary tumor, 
histopathology, and bone localization in the group of patients with painful bone 
metastases.
METHODS: A clinical, prospective, non-randomized study was conducted at the 
Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, which included 64 patients with 
noncomplicated, painful bone metastases who underwent palliative, pain-relieving 
radiation therapy with a single tumor dose of 8Gy in a single hospital visit. 
Response to treatment was patient reported via telephone interview using visual 
analog scale. The response assessment was based on the international consensus 
panel of radiation oncologists.
RESULTS: In the entire group of patients, 83% responded to radiotherapy. No 
statistically significant difference was observed in response to therapy, time 
to reach the maximum response, degree of pain reduction, nor in response 
duration depending on the patient's age, performance status, the primary origin 
of the tumor, histopathology, or location of the metastasis (bone) that was 
irradiated.
CONCLUSION: Regardless of clinical parameters, palliative radiotherapy with a 
single dose of 8Gy can be considered very effective in quick pain relief in 
patients with noncomplicated painful bone metastases. Single fraction 
radiotherapy in a single hospital visit, as well as patient-reported outcome for 
these patients may be considered favorable beyond Covid pandemics.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6231

CASE: The patient was a 44- year-old woman who underwent surgery for right 
breast cancer. T-DXd was introduced as the fourth-line metastatic treatment for 
multiple metastases, including liver, bone, pituitary, brain, and spinal cord 
metastases. Hematologic and non- hematologic toxicities did not occur during the

and symptoms such as numbness in the left lower limb were controlled without 
progression of the brain and spinal cord, although T-DXd-induced interstitial 
lung disease was a concern.
DISCUSSION: ISCM is a rare metastatic lesion that is difficult to treat with 
chemotherapy due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and there is no established 
treatment for ISCM. T-DXd has shown promising results in previous clinical 
trials, including in patients with central nerve system (CNS) metastases, and is

metabolism in ovarian cancer (OC), so as to increase the understanding of 
potential inhibitors targeting SIK2 and lay a foundation for future precision 
medicine in OC patients.
METHODS: We reviewed and summarized the regulation effect of SIK2 on glycolysis, 
gluconeogenesis, lipid synthesis, and fatty acids β-oxidation (FAO) in OC, as 
well as the potential molecular mechanism and the prospects of potential 
inhibitors targeting SIK2 in future cancer treatments.
RESULTS: Many pieces of evidence show that SIK2 is closed associated with 
glucose and lipid metabolism of OC. On the one hand, SIK2 enhances the Warburg 
effect by promoting glycolysis and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and 
gluconeogenesis, on the other hand, SIK2 regulates intracellular lipid 
metabolism through promoting lipid synthesis and FAO, all of which ultimately 
induces growth, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance 
of OC. On this basis, SIK2 targeting may become a new solution for the treatment 
of a variety of cancer types including OC. The efficacy of some small molecule 
kinase inhibitors has also been demonstrated in tumor clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: SIK2 displays significant effects in OC progression and treatment 
through regulating cellular metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism. 
Therefore, future research needs to further explore the molecular mechanisms of 
SIK2 in other types of energy metabolism in OC, based on this to develop more 
unique and effective inhibitors.",© 2023 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.,"DOI: 10.1111/jog.15714

intracellular pH has been linked to common diseases such as cancer and 
Alzheimer's. To address this issue, a water-soluble fluorescent pH probe was 
designed based on the protonation/deprotonation of the 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl 
group, using dicyanoisophorone as the fluorophore. In the neutral form of the 
probe, fluorescence is quenched due to charge transfer from the 
4-methylpiperazin-1-yl group to the fluorophore upon excitation. Under acidic 
conditions, protonation of the 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl group inhibits the 
photoinduced electron transfer process, leading to an increase in fluorescence 
intensity. Density-functional theory calculations also verified the fluorescence 
OFF-ON mechanism. The probe exhibits high selectivity, photostability, fast 
response to pH changes, and low cytotoxicity to cells. Additionally, the probe 
selectively accumulates in lysosomes, with a high Pearson coefficient (0.95) 
using LysoTracker Green DND-26 as a reference. Notably, the probe can monitor 
lysosomal pH changes in living cells and track pH changes stimulated by 
chloroquine. We anticipate that the probe has potential for diagnosing 
pH-related diseases.","DOI: 10.1039/d3ay00343d

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women who underwent fertility preservation following the 
diagnosis of breast cancer from 2008 to 2018 were included in the study. Patient 
age, ovarian stimulation parameters and laboratory outcomes were recorded and 
compared between the ER positive and negative groups. The primary outcome was 
total number of oocytes frozen. Secondary outcomes included total number of 
oocytes collected, mature oocytes, and embryos frozen.
RESULTS: The women included in the study (n = 214) were analysed in the 
following groups based on their fertility preservation method: oocyte freezing 
(n = 131), embryo freezing (n = 70), and both embryo and oocyte freezing 
(n = 13). There was an increase in the mean (but not mature) number of oocytes 
frozen (12.4 and 9.2, P-value = 0.03) favouring the ER positive group, even

sarcoma is complex and requires input from a number of different specialists. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of agreement in terms of 
resectability, treatment allocation, and organs proposed to be resected across 
different retroperitoneal sarcoma multidisciplinary team meetings.
METHODS: The CT scans and clinical information of 21 anonymized retroperitoneal 
sarcoma patients were sent to all of the retroperitoneal sarcoma 
multidisciplinary team meetings in Great Britain, which were asked to give an 
opinion about resectability, treatment allocation, and organs proposed to be 
resected. The main outcome was inter-centre reliability, which was quantified 
using overall agreement, as well as the chance-corrected Krippendorff's alpha 
statistic. Based on the latter, the level of agreement was classified as: 
'slight' (0.00-0.20), 'fair' (0.21-0.40), 'moderate' (0.41-0.60), 'substantial' 
(0.61-0.80), or 'near-perfect' (>0.80).
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were reviewed at 12 retroperitoneal sarcoma 
multidisciplinary team meetings, giving a total of 252 assessments for analysis. 
Consistency between centres was only 'slight' to 'fair', with rates of overall 
agreement and Krippendorff's alpha statistics of 85.4 per cent (211 of 247) and 
0.37 (95 per cent c.i. 0.11 to 0.57) for resectability; 80.4 per cent (201 of 
250) and 0.39 (95 per cent c.i. 0.33 to 0.45) for treatment allocation; and 53.0 
per cent (131 of 247) and 0.20 (95 per cent c.i. 0.17 to 0.23) for the organs 
proposed to be resected. Depending on the centre that they had attended, 12 of 
21 patients could either have been deemed resectable or unresectable, and 10 of 
21 could have received either potentially curative or palliative treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Inter-centre agreement between retroperitoneal sarcoma 
multidisciplinary team meetings was low. Multidisciplinary team meetings may not 
provide the same standard of care for patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma 
across Great Britain.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of BJS

asymmetry-based (APTwasym ), Lorentzian-fit-based (PeakAreaAPT and MTconst ), 
and relaxation-compensated (MTRRex APT and MTRRex MT) CEST contrasts of the 
amide proton transfer (APT) and semi-solid magnetization transfer (ssMT) for 
early response assessment and prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) in 
patients with glioma.
METHODS: Seventy-two study participants underwent CEST-MRI at 3T from July 2018 
to December 2021 in a prospective clinical trial four to 6 wk after the 
completion of radiotherapy for diffuse glioma. Tumor segmentations were 
performed on T2w -FLAIR and contrast-enhanced T1w images. Therapy response 
assessment and determination of PFS were performed according to response 
assessment in neuro oncology (RANO) criteria using clinical follow-up data with 
a median observation time of 9.2 mo (range, 1.6-40.8) and compared to CEST MRI 
metrics. Statistical testing included receiver operating characteristic 
analyses, Mann-Whitney-U-test, Kaplan-Meier analyses, and logrank-test.
RESULTS: MTconst (AUC = 0.79, p < 0.01) showed a stronger association with RANO 
response assessment compared to PeakAreaAPT (AUC = 0.71, p = 0.02) and MTRRex MT 
(AUC = 0.71, p = 0.02), and enabled differentiation of participants with 
pseudoprogression (n = 8) from those with true progression (AUC = 0.79, 
p = 0.02). Furthermore, MTconst (HR = 3.04, p = 0.01), PeakAreaAPT (HR = 0.39, 
p = 0.03), and APTwasym (HR = 2.63, p = 0.02) were associated with PFS. MTRRex 
APT was not associated with any outcome.
CONCLUSION: MTconst , PeakAreaAPT, and APTwasym imaging predict clinical outcome 
by means of progression-free survival. Furthermore, MTconst enables 
differentiation of radiation-induced pseudoprogression from disease progression. 
Therefore, the assessed metrics may have synergistic potential for supporting 
clinical decision making during follow-up of patients with glioma.","© 2023 The Authors. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley

(EUS-FNA/B) is essential in diagnosing solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs), but 
without rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), a repeat EUS-FNA/B is crucial for 
clarifying an inconclusive diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate factors associated 
with improved diagnostic performance of repeat EUS-FNA/B for initially 
inconclusive SPL diagnoses without ROSE.
METHODS: Of 5,894 patients subjected to EUS-FNA/B, 237 (4.0%) with an initially 
inconclusive diagnosis of SPLs were retrospectively enrolled from five tertiary 
medical centers between January 2016 and June 2021. Diagnostic performance and 
procedural factors of EUS-FNA/B were analyzed.
RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracies of first and repeat EUS-FNA/B were 96.2% and 
67.6%, respectively. Of 237 patients with an inconclusive diagnosis from initial 
EUS-FNA/B, 150 were pathologically diagnosed after repeat EUS-FNA/B. In 
multivariate analysis of repeat EUS-FNA/B, tumor location (body/tail vs head: 
odds ratio [OR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 9.46), number of 
needle passes (≥4 vs ≤3: OR, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.44 to 15.99), needle type (FNB vs 
FNA: OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.44 to 7.36), needle size (22 gauge vs 19/20 gauge: OR, 
2.35; 95% CI, 1.19 to 4.62), and suction method (suction vs others: OR, 5.19; 
95% CI, 1.30 to 20.75) were associated with a significantly improved diagnostic 
performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeat EUS-FNA/B is essential for patients with an inconclusive 
EUS-FNA/B without ROSE. To improve the diagnostic performance of repeated 
EUS-FNA/B, it is recommended that 22-gauge FNB needles, ≥4 needle passes, and

cerebrovascular event (CVE) and compare it to the cancer incidence in the 
population from the same region.
METHODS: We evaluated 1069 patients with a first-ever CVE (Ischaemic or 
haemorrhagic stroke and Transient Ischaemic Attack) from a prospective 
population registry of stroke and transient focal neurological attacks, 
diagnosed between 2009 and 2011. We conducted a structured search to identify 
cancer-related variables and case-fatality for a period of 8 years following 
CVE. Cancer incidence in CVE patients was compared to the North Region Cancer 
Registry (RORENO).
RESULTS: We found that 90/1069 (8.4%) CVE patients developed cancer after a 
first-ever CVE. Overall cancer annual incidence rate was higher after a CVE 
(820/100,000, 95%CI: 619-1020) than in general population (513/100,000, 95%CI: 
508-518). In the 45-54 age group cancer incidence post-CVE was 3.2-fold (RR, 
95%CI: 1.6-6.4) higher compared to the general population, decreasing gradually 
in older age-groups. Median time between CVE and cancer was 3.2 years 
(IQR = 1.4-5.2). Lower respiratory tract and colorectal were the most frequent 
cancer types. In univariable models, male sex (sHR = 1.78, 95%CI: 1.17-2.72, 
p = 0.007), tobacco use (sHR = 2.04, 95%CI: 1.31-3.18, p = 0.002) and peripheral 
artery disease (sHR = 2.37, 95%CI: 1.10-5.13, p = 0.028) were associated to 
higher cancer risk after CVE. After adjustment, tobacco use (sHR = 1.84, 95%CI: 
1.08-3.14, p = 0.026) remained associated to a higher risk of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: At the population level, patients presenting a first-ever CVE have 
higher cancer incidence, that is particularly prominent in younger age-groups. 
Higher cancer incidence, delayed cancer diagnosis and increased mortality 
post-CVE warrants further research on long-term cancer surveillance in 
first-ever CVE survivors.","DOI: 10.1177/23969873231181628

(MD) and mixed-type (MT) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) in 
suitable patients. However, there is little evidence regarding the malignancy 
risk of enhancing mural nodules (EMNs) that are present only in the main 
pancreatic duct (MPD) in patients with MD- and MT-IPMNs. Therefore, this study 
aimed to identify the clinical and morphological features associated with 
malignancy in MD- and MT-IPMNs with EMNs only in the MPD.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 50 patients with MD- and MT-IPMNs with EMNs 
only in the MPD on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated 
the clinical characteristics and preoperative radiologic imaging results of MPD 
morphology and EMN size and analyzed the risk factors associated with 
malignancy.
RESULTS: Histological findings of EMNs were low-grade dysplasia (38%), malignant 
lesions (62%), high-grade dysplasia (34%), and invasive carcinoma (28%). On the 
receiver operating characteristic curve, the cutoff value of EMN size on 
magnetic resonance imaging for best predicting malignancy was 5 mm (sensitivity, 
93.5%; specificity, 52.6%; area under the curve, 0.753). Multivariate analysis 
showed that only EMN >5 mm (odds ratio, 27.69; confidence interval, 2.75 to 
278.73; p=0.050) was an independent risk factor for malignancy.
CONCLUSIONS: EMNs of >5 mm are associated with malignancy in patients with MD- 
and MT-IPMNs with EMNs that are present only in the MPD, in accordance with the 
international consensus guidelines.","DOI: 10.5009/gnl220378

events after esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in patients with gastric cancer 
(GC) is unclear. We investigated the incidence rate and impact of sedation on 
CCV adverse events after surveillance EGD in patients with GC.
METHODS: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the 
Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service databases from January 1, 2018, 
to December 31, 2020. Using a propensity score-matched analysis, patients with 
GC were divided into two groups: sedative agent users and nonusers for 
surveillance EGD. We compared the occurrence of CCV adverse events within 14 
days between the two groups.
RESULTS: Of the 103,463 patients with GC, newly diagnosed CCV adverse events 
occurred in 2.57% of patients within 14 days after surveillance EGD. Sedative 
agents were used in 41.3% of the patients during EGD. The incidence rates of CCV 
adverse events with and without sedation were 173.6/10,000 and 315.4/10,000, 
respectively. Between sedative agent users and nonusers based on propensity 
score matching (28,008 pairs), there were no significant differences in the 
occurrence of 14-day CCV, cardiac, cerebral, and other vascular adverse events 
(2.28% vs 2.22%, p=0.69; 1.44% vs 1.31%, p=0.23; 0.74% vs 0.84%, p=0.20; 0.10% 
vs 0.07%, p=0.25, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Sedation during surveillance EGD was not associated with CCV 
adverse events in patients with GC. Therefore, the use of sedative agents may be 
considered in patients with GC during surveillance EGD without excessive 
concerns about CCV adverse events.","DOI: 10.5009/gnl230043

METHODS: Ovarian cancer tissues were collected clinically and 
immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of p53 and p21. Ovarian 
cancer cells were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5, 10 μmol/L Rosline for 24 h. 100 nmol/L 
Pifithrin-α pre-incubation was used to inhibit the transcriptional activity of

METHODS: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database, 207 patients 
with pregnancy-related TMA from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2015 were 
enrolled. Their data were compared with a 1:4 propensity score-matched cohort of

the precursor to kynurenine, an immunosuppressive molecule that plays a role in 
limiting anticancer immunity. Tryptophanase (TNase) is an enzyme expressed by 
different bacterial species that converts tryptophan into indole, pyruvate and 
ammonia, but is absent in the Salmonella strain VNP20009 that has been used as a 
therapeutic delivery vector. We cloned the Escherichia coli TNase operon tnaCAB 
into the VNP20009 (VNP20009-tnaCAB), and were able to detect linear production 
of indole over time, using Kovács reagent. In order to conduct further 
experiments using the whole bacteria, we added the antibiotic gentamicin to stop 
bacterial replication. Using a fixed number of bacteria, we found that there was 
no significant effect of gentamicin on stationary phase VNP20009-tnaCAB upon 
their ability to convert tryptophan to indole over time. We developed a 
procedure to extract indole from media while retaining tryptophan, and were able 
to measure tryptophan spectrophotometrically after exposure to 
gentamicin-inactivated whole bacterial cells. Using the tryptophan concentration 
equivalent to that present in DMEM cell culture media, a fixed number of 
bacteria were able to deplete 93.9% of the tryptophan in the culture media in 4 
h. In VNP20009-tnaCAB depleted tissue culture media, MDA-MB-468 triple negative 
breast cancer cells were unable to divide, while those treated with media 
exposed only to VNP20009 continued cell division. Re-addition of tryptophan to 
conditioned culture media restored tumor cell growth. Treatment of tumor cells 
with molar equivalents of the TNase products indole, pyruvate and ammonia only 
caused a slight increase in tumor cell growth. Using an ELISA assay, we 
confirmed that TNase depletion of tryptophan also limits the production of 
immunosuppressive kynurenine in IFNγ-stimulated MDA-MB-468 cancer cells. Our 
results demonstrate that Salmonella VNP20009 expressing TNase has improved 
potential to stop tumor cell growth and reverse immunosuppression.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051355

an acute and highly contagious disease. Individuals with comorbidities and in 
the extremes of age are classified as risk groups for serious clinical outcomes. 
However, part of the severe infections and fatalities are observed among young 
healthy individuals. Noteworthy, influenza infections lack specific prognostic 
biomarkers that would predict the disease severity. Osteopontin (OPN) has been 
proposed as a biomarker in a few human malignancies and its differential 
modulation has been observed during viral infections. However, OPN expression 
levels in the primary site of IAV infection have not been previously 
investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the transcriptional expression patterns of 
total OPN (tOPN) and its splicing isoforms (OPNa, OPNb, OPNc, OPN4, and OPN5) in 
176 respiratory secretion samples collected from human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
cases and a group of 65 IAV-negative controls. IAV samples were differentially 
classified according to their disease severity. tOPN was more frequently 
detected in IAV samples (34.1%) when compared with the negative controls (18.5%) 
(p < 0.05), as well as in fatal (59.1%) versus non-fatal IAV samples (30.5%) (p 
< 0.01). OPN4 splice variant transcript was more prevalent in IAV cases (78.4%) 
than in the negative controls (66.1%) (p = 0.05) and in severe cases (85.7%) in 
relation to the non-severe ones (69.2%) (p < 0.01). OPN4 detection was also 
associated with severity symptoms such as dyspnea (p < 0.05), respiratory 
failure (p < 0.05), and oxygen saturation < 95% (p < 0.05). In addition, the 
OPN4 expression level was increased in the fatal cases of respiratory samples.

remain uncharacterized. To characterize gut microbial and fungal profiles in 
ALGD and normal colorectal mucosa tissues. We used 16S and ITS1-2 rRNA gene 
sequencing and bioinformatics analysis on the microbiota of ALGD and normal

analysis showed a decrease in pathways related to the biosynthesis of gondoate

leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The primary risk factor implicated in 
gastric cancer development is infection with Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori 
induces chronic inflammation affecting the gastric epithelium, which can lead to 
DNA damage and the promotion of precancerous lesions. Disease manifestations 
associated with H. pylori are attributed to virulence factors with multiple 
activities, and its capacity to subvert host immunity. One of the most 
significant H. pylori virulence determinants is the cagPAI gene cluster, which 
encodes a type IV secretion system and the CagA toxin. This secretion system 
allows H. pylori to inject the CagA oncoprotein into host cells, causing 
multiple cellular perturbations. Despite the high prevalence of H. pylori 
infection, only a small percentage of affected individuals develop significant 
clinical outcomes, while most remain asymptomatic. Therefore, understanding how 
H. pylori triggers carcinogenesis and its immune evasion mechanisms is critical 
in preventing gastric cancer and mitigating the burden of this life-threatening 
disease. This review aims to provide an overview of our current understanding of 
H. pylori infection, its association with gastric cancer and other gastric 
diseases, and how it subverts the host immune system to establish persistent 
infection.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051312

silencing is insufficient to prevent the production of the encoded proteins for 
which immune tolerance appears to be limited. One such protein is the 
transmembrane envelope (Env) protein encoded by human endogenous retrovirus K 
(HERV-K). We reported recently that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have 
IgG autoantibodies that recognize Env. Here, we use RNA sequencing of RA 
neutrophils to analyze HERV-K expression and find that only two loci with an 
intact open-reading frame for Env, HERV-K102, and K108 are expressed, but only 
the former is increased in RA. In contrast, other immune cells express more K108 
than K102. Patient autoantibodies recognized endogenously expressed Env in 
breast cancer cells and in RA neutrophils but not healthy controls. A monoclonal 
anti-Env antibody also detected Env on the surface of RA neutrophils but very 
little on the surface of other immune cells. We conclude that HERV-K102 is the 
locus that produces Env detectable on the surface of neutrophils in RA. The low 
levels of HERV-K108 transcripts may contribute only marginally to cell surface 
Env on neutrophils or other immune cells in some patients.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051310

countries, where they represent a gastronomic heritage well distinguished from

meat, a food commodity that is under attack because of evidence of increased 
risk of cancer and degenerative diseases with high consumption. However, 
traditional fermented meat products are intended for moderate consumption and 
gastronomic experience, and, as such, their production must be continued, which 
would also help safeguard the culture and economy of the geographical areas of

considered, and how these risks are reduced by the application of autochthonous 
microbial cultures is highlighted by reviewing studies reporting the effects of 
autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB), coagulase negative staphylococci

chemical safety and on sensory attributes. The role of dry fermented sausages as 
a source of microorganisms that can be beneficial to the host is also

and identified species (81.25%). Of all the isolated B. cereus sensu lato 
strains, 93.75% presented at least one gene for some diarrheagenic toxins, 87.5% 
formed biofilms, and 18.75% were amylolytic. All B. cereus sensu lato strains 
were resistant to beta-lactams and folate inhibitors. A close phylogenetic 
relationship between isolates was found between the cheese isolates and the air 
isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: Strains of B. cereus sensu lato were found in small-scale artisanal 
cheeses on a farm in southwestern Mexico.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051290

their hosts. Fucose, a mucin degradation product, was suggested as a 
communication molecule between the resident microbiota and external pathogens. 
However, the precise role and variants of the fucose utilization pathway remain 
to be elucidated. Here, we computationally and experimentally investigated the 
fucose utilization operon of E. coli. While the operon is conserved among E. 
coli genomes, a variant pathway, in which an ABC transporter system replaces the 
fucose permease gene (fucP), was computationally identified in 50 out of 1058 
genomes. Comparative genomics and subsystems analysis results were confirmed by 
polymerase chain reaction-based screening of 40 human E. coli isolates, which 
indicated the conservation of fucP in 92.5% of the isolates (vs. 7.5% of its 
suggested alternative, yjfF). The in silico predictions were confirmed by in 
vitro experiments comparing the growth of E. coli strains K12, BL21, and 
isogenic fucose-utilization K12 mutants. Additionally, fucP and fucI transcripts 
were quantified in E. coli K12 and BL21, after in silico analysis of their 
expression in 483 public transcriptomes. In conclusion, E. coli utilizes fucose 
by two pathway variants, with measurable transcriptional differences. Future 
studies will explore this variation's impact on signaling and virulence.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051265

affects more than half of the world's population. Although this infection can 
have serious consequences, no novel cure or remedy have been discovered, the 
present therapy still relies on a variety of known antibiotics and 
anti-secretory agents. In the present study, the potential effect of 
combinations between methanolic extracts of four Algerian medicinal plants, 
garlic (Allium sativum), red onion (Allium cepa), cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) and 
fenugreek (T. foenum-graecum L.), with different strains of lactic acid bacteria 
against H. pylori, was investigated. Similarly, the in vivo antibacterial effect 
of fenugreek extract combined with Bifidobacterium breve on H. pylori 
colonization potential to confirm the enhanced effect of the mixture was 
explored. Helicobacter pylori was inhibited by all combined mixtures of extracts 
and probiotics with varying results. The highest anti-H. pylori activities were 
found in fenugreek/B. breve, cumin/B. breve, garlic/B. breve and onion/B. breve 
combinations with inhibition diameters of 29, 26, 23 and 25 mm, respectively. 
Preliminary studies on the effect of probiotics against H. pylori revealed that 
the inhibition was due to lactic acid and bacteriocins and it was also related 
to the presence of phenolic compounds in the studied plants, such as gallic 
acid, caffeic acid, quercetin and vanillic acid. Fenugreek extract was found to 
inhibit the growth of H. pylori in a concentration-dependent manner. When H. 
pylori-infected rats were administered B. breve, the infection rate of H. pylori 
was significantly reduced, while the combination of B. breve and fenugreek 
extract effectively inhibited H. pylori. In addition, the B. breve and fenugreek 
extract mixture significantly reduced gastritis in H. pylori-infected rats. 
These results suggest that this complex mixture may be an alternative to 
treating diseases caused by H. pylori infection.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051242

microbiota in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to 
elucidate the architecture of microbial communities within normal and neoplastic 
colonic mucosa.
METHODS: Microbiota were analyzed by NGS and by an ensemble of metagenomics 
analysis tools in a total of 69 tissues from 9 patients with synchronous 
colorectal neoplasia and adenomas (27 specimens: 9 from normal tissues, 9 
adenomas, and 9 tumours), 16 patients with only colonic adenomas (32 specimens: 
16 from normal tissues and 16 adenomas), and from healthy subjects (10 specimens 
of normal mucosa).
RESULTS: Weak differences were observed in alpha and beta metrics among the 
synchronous tissues from CRC and controls. Through pairwise differential 
abundance analyses of sample groups, an increasing trend of Rikenellaceae, 
Pseudomonas and Fusobacterium, and decreasing trends of Staphylococcus, 
Actinobacillus and Gemmiger were observed in CRC, while Staphylococcus and 
Bifidobacterium were decreased in patients with only adenomas. At RT-qPCR 
analysis, Fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly enriched in all the tissues 
of subjects with synchronous colorectal neoplasia.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the human 
mucosa-associated gut microbiota, emphasizing global microbial diversity mostly 
in synchronous lesions and proving the constant presence of Fusobacterium 
nucleatum, with its ability to drive carcinogenesis.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051147

to hospitals is occurring late in their illness, which has contributed to the 
increase in poor outcomes and high fatalities worldwide across age groups. The 
current diagnostic and monitoring procedure relies on an inaccurate and often 
delayed identification by the clinician, who then decides the treatment upon 
interaction with the patient. Initiation of sepsis is accompanied by immune 
system paralysis following ""cytokine storm"". The unique immunological response 
of each patient is important to define in terms of subtyping for therapy. The 
immune system becomes activated in sepsis to produce interleukins, and 
endothelial cells express higher levels of adhesion molecules. The proportions 
of circulating immune cells change, reducing regulatory cells and increasing 
memory cells and killer cells, having long-term effects on the phenotype of CD8 
T cells, HLA-DR, and dysregulation of microRNA. The current narrative review 
seeks to highlight the potential application of multi-omics data integration and 
immunological profiling at the single-cell level to define endotypes in sepsis 
and septic shock. The review will consider the parallels and immunoregulatory 
axis between cancer and immunosuppression, sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, and 
endothelial damage. Second, the added value of transcriptomic-driven endotypes 
will be assessed through inferring regulatory interactions in recent clinical 
trials and studies reporting gene modular features that inform continuous 
metrics measuring clinical response in ICU, which can support the use of 
immunomodulating agents.","DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11051119

collected from AH patients (n = 2), mild classical haemophilia (n = 3), severe 
classical haemophilia (n = 3) and healthy donors (n = 2), for sequencing by

with cancer treated with ICI were studied. The serum sICAM-1 levels of baseline, 
post two cycle therapy and end of therapy (EOT) were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunoassay. We randomly assigned the patients into the primary cohort (n = 47) 
and validation cohort (n = 48). Serum sICAM-1 post two cycle 
(277.7 ± 181.6 ng/mL) and EOT (403.9 ± 218.9 ng/mL) were significantly elevated

cycles minus baseline, were assessed. Following ICI treatments, responders had 
significantly lower ΔsICAM-1 compared with nonresponders in the primary cohort 
(p = 0.040) and the validation cohort (p = 0.026). High ΔsICAM-1 was strongly 
associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS; (primary cohort:

cohort: p < 0.001 and validation cohort: p = 0.007). The ΔsICAM-1 remained 
independently associated with worse PFS and OS in the primary cohort and the 
validation cohort. Subgroup analysis indicated patients whose sICAM-1 
significantly elevated had shorter PFS and OS in both anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 
treatment groups. Early change of serum sICAM-1 could be used to monitor and

splicing factor family, has been shown to control mRNA splicing in development 
and cancers. However, it remains unclear whether TRA2A is involved in lncRNA 
regulation. In the present study, we found that TRA2A was upregulated and 
correlated with poor prognosis in esophageal cancer. Downregulation of TRA2A 
suppressed the tumor growth in xenograft nude mice. Epitranscriptomic microarray 
showed that depletion of TRA2A affected global lncRNA methylation similarly to 
the key m6 A methyltransferase, METTL3, by silencing. MeRIP-qPCR, RNA pull-down, 
CLIP analyses, and stability assays indicated that ablation of TRA2A reduced m6 
A-modification of the oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1, thus inducing structural 
alterations and reduced stability. Furthermore, Co-IP experiments showed TRA2A 
directly interacted with METTL3 and RBMX, which also affected the writer 
KIAA1429 expression. Knockdown of TRA2A inhibited cell proliferation in a manner 
restored by RBMX/KIAA1429 overexpression. Clinically, MALAT1, RBMX, and KIAA1429 
were prognostic factors of worse survival in ESCA patients. Structural 
similarity-based virtual screening in FDA-approved drugs repurposed nebivolol, a 
β1 -adrenergic receptor antagonist, as a potent compound to suppress the 
proliferation of esophageal cancer cells. Cellular thermal shift and RIP assay 
indicated that nebivolol may compete with MALAT1 to bind TRA2A. In conclusion, 
our study revealed the noncanonical function of TRA2A, which coordinates with

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not been comprehensively studied in the 
United States.
METHODS: Data from 6 nationally representative data sets over the last decade 
(Classification of Laws Associated with School Students, Early Childhood 
Longitudinal Study, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, National 
Youth Fitness Survey, School Health Policies and Practices Survey, and the 
School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study) provided estimates for adherence to CDC 
recess guidelines.
RESULTS: While approximately 65-80% of elementary school-children receive the 
recommended 20+ minutes of daily recess according to parent-, principal-, and 
school-report, adherence declines by sixth grade, and little information is 
available for middle/high school students. Adherence to playground safety was 
high (90%), but adherence to recommendations about recess before lunch (<50%), 
withholding recess as punishment (∼50%), and training recess staff (<50%) were 
lower.
CONCLUSIONS: School policy and practice should align with CDC recommendations, 
with the aim of providing sufficient quality recess to all youth, K-12th grade.

DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Individuals of South Asian 
heritage were recruited via a mix of convenience sampling and purposive 
sampling, with outreach via radio, posters in community settings, and from 
outreach to participants in current exercise oncology studies. Inclusion 
criteria included being over the age of 18; diagnosed with any cancer type and 
stage; pre, during, or post-treatment; able to speak English, Hindi, or Punjabi; 
and self-identified as South Asian. Data for this study was collected via 
semi-structured interviews conducted in the participants language of choice. 
Interviews were transcribed verbatim in the original language and then analyzed 
using conventional content analysis. For non-English interviews, the codes 
created through analysis were subsequently translated into English, and 
back-translated into the original language, to ensure accuracy. These codes were 
then organized into themes and categories.
RESULTS: Eight participants were recruited, with 5 interviews conducted in 
Punjabi and 3 interviews in English. The three themes that were created from the 
participant interviews include: (1) Culture, (2) Informational Needs, and (3) 
The Nature of Exercise Oncology Interventions. Within these themes, categories 
included barriers and facilitators to PA, as well as PA needs.
CONCLUSION: Participants' perspectives provided insights into the PA 
experiences, barriers, facilitators, and needs of people of South Asian heritage 
living with and beyond cancer. These results can be used to inform the tailoring 
of exercise oncology resources to better support physical activity and exercise 
for this population.","DOI: 10.1080/13557858.2023.2224951

sequencing (WGS) of plasma microbial cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a novel 
non-invasive method in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with 
hematologic malignancy (HM) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: Adults with HM or COVID-19 and suspected IA were recruited. IA cases 
were retrospectively diagnosed according to EORTC/MSG definitions and ECMM/ISHAM 
criteria for HM and COVID-19 patients, respectively. The results of cfDNA WGS 
were compared with the conventional diagnosis.
RESULTS: Microbial cfDNA WGS was performed 53 times from 41 participants (19 
from HM, 16 from COVID-19, and 7 from the control group). In participants with 
HM, Aspergillus cfDNA was detected in 100% of proven IA and 91.7% of probable IA 
cases. In participants with COVID-19, 50.0% of probable IA were positive for 
Aspergillus in cfDNA WGS. Concordance between Aspergillus cfDNA detection and 
proven/probable IA conventional diagnosis was significantly higher in 
participants with HM than in those with COVID-19. IA diagnosed using EORTC/MGS 
definitions showed significantly high concordance between Aspergillus cfDNA 
detection and proven/probable IA.
CONCLUSIONS: Aspergillus cfDNA detection strongly correlated with 
proven/probable IA diagnosed using EORTC/MSG definitions and could be used as an 
additional diagnostic tool for IA.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of

instigator of systemic inflammation and autoimmune responses following 
Salmonella infection. Systemic curli injections or infection of mice with 
Salmonella Typhimurium induce the major features of reactive arthritis, an 
autoimmune disorder associated with Salmonella infection in humans. In this 
study, we investigated the link between inflammation and microbiota in 
exacerbating autoimmunity. We studied C57BL/6 mice from two sources, Taconic 
Farms and Jackson Labs. Mice from Taconic Farms have been reported to have 
higher basal levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL - 17 than do mice from 
Jackson Labs due to the differences in their microbiota. When we systemically 
injected mice with purified curli, we observed a significant increase in 
diversity in the microbiota of Jackson Labs mice but not in that of the Taconic 
mice. In Jackson Labs, mice, the most striking effect was the expansion of 
Prevotellaceae. Furthermore, there were increases in the relative abundance of 
the family Akkermansiaceae and decreases in families Clostridiaceae and 
Muribaculaceae in Jackson Labs mice. Curli treatment led to significantly 
aggravated immune responses in the Taconic mice compared to Jackson Labs 
counterparts. Expression and production of IL - 1β, a cytokine known to promote 
IL - 17 production, as well as expression of Tnfa increased in the gut mucosa of 
Taconic mice in the first 24 hours after curli injections, which correlated with 
significant increases in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the 
mesenteric lymph nodes. A significant increase in the expression of Ccl3 in 
colon and cecum of Taconic mice injected with curli was detected. Taconic mice 
injected with curli also had elevated levels of inflammation in their knees. 
Overall, our data suggest that autoimmune responses to bacterial ligands, such 
as curli, are amplified in individuals with a microbiome that promote 
inflammation.","DOI: 10.1080/19490976.2023.2221813

in the era after Covid that caused delay to treatment. The aim of this study was 
to determine whether a delayed start to curative treatment, within 29-56 days 
after a diagnosis of colon cancer, was noninferior to starting treatment within 
28 days, with regard to all-cause mortality.
METHOD: This is a national register-based observational noninferiority study, 
with a noninferiority margin of hazard ratio (HR) 1.1, including all patients 
treated with curative intent for colon cancer in Sweden between 2008 and 2016. 
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of 
hospital stay, readmissions and reoperations within 1 year after surgery. 
Exclusion criteria were emergency surgery, disseminated disease at diagnosis, 
missing diagnosis date and treatment for another cancer 5 years before colon 
cancer diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 20 836 individuals were included. A period of 29-56 days 
from diagnosis to start of curative treatment was noninferior versus starting 
treatment within 28 days for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality (HR 
0.95, 95% CI 0.89-1.00). Starting treatment within 29-56 days was associated 
with a shorter length of stay (average 9.2 vs. 10 days) but a higher risk of 
reoperation compared to within 28 days. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that 
surgical modality was driving survival rather than time to treatment. Overall 
survival was greater after laparoscopic surgery (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.88).
CONCLUSION: For patients with colon cancer, a period of up to 56 days from 
diagnosis to the start of curative treatment did not lead to worse overall 
survival.","© 2023 The Authors. Colorectal Disease published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on

clinical concept extraction and relation extraction in a unified prompt-based 
machine reading comprehension (MRC) architecture with good generalizability for 
cross-institution applications.
METHODS: We formulate both clinical concept extraction and relation extraction 
using a unified prompt-based MRC architecture and explore state-of-the-art 
transformer models. We compare our MRC models with existing deep learning models 
for concept extraction and end-to-end relation extraction using 2 benchmark 
datasets developed by the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge 
(medications and adverse drug events) and the 2022 n2c2 challenge (relations of 
social determinants of health [SDoH]). We also evaluate the transfer learning 
ability of the proposed MRC models in a cross-institution setting. We perform 
error analyses and examine how different prompting strategies affect the 
performance of MRC models.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The proposed MRC models achieve state-of-the-art 
performance for clinical concept and relation extraction on the 2 benchmark 
datasets, outperforming previous non-MRC transformer models. GatorTron-MRC 
achieves the best strict and lenient F1-scores for concept extraction, 
outperforming previous deep learning models on the 2 datasets by 1%-3% and 
0.7%-1.3%, respectively. For end-to-end relation extraction, GatorTron-MRC and 
BERT-MIMIC-MRC achieve the best F1-scores, outperforming previous deep learning 
models by 0.9%-2.4% and 10%-11%, respectively. For cross-institution evaluation, 
GatorTron-MRC outperforms traditional GatorTron by 6.4% and 16% for the 2 
datasets, respectively. The proposed method is better at handling 
nested/overlapped concepts, extracting relations, and has good portability for

hallmark of which is the loss of expression of SMARCB1, a key member of the 
SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodelling complex. Hampered 
by its rarity, epithelioid sarcoma has received little research attention and 
therapeutic options for this disease remain limited. SMARCB1-deficient tumours 
also include malignant rhabdoid tumour, atypical teratoid and rhabdoid tumour, 
epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, and poorly differentiated 
chordoma. Histologically, it can be challenging to distinguish epithelioid 
sarcoma from malignant rhabdoid tumour and other SMARCB1-deficient tumours, 
whereas methylation profiling shows that they represent distinct entities and 
facilitates their classification. Methylation studies on SMARCB1-deficient 
tumours, although not including epithelioid sarcomas, reported methylation 
subgroups which resulted in new clinical stratification and therapeutic 
approaches. In addition, emerging evidence indicates that immunotherapy, 
including immune checkpoint inhibitors, represents a promising therapeutic 
strategy for SMARCB1-deficient tumours. Here, we show that some epithelioid 
sarcomas share methylation patterns of malignant rhabdoid tumours indicating 
that this could help to distinguish these entities and guide treatment. Using 
gene expression data, we also showed that the immune environment of epithelioid 
sarcoma is characterised by a predominance of CD8+ lymphocytes and M2 
macrophages. These findings have potential implications for the management of

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of using a 3D-printed total skin 
bolus in total skin helical tomotherapy for the treatment of mycosis fungoides.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 65-year-old female patient with a 3-year history of 
mycosis fungoides underwent treatment using an in-house desktop fused deposition 
modelling printer to create a total skin bolus made of a 5-mm-thick flexible 
material, which increased the skin dose through dose building. The patient's 
scan was segmented into upper and lower sections, with the division line placed 
10 cm above the patella. The prescription was to deliver 24 Gy over 24 
fractions, given 5 times per week. The plan parameters consisted of a field 
width of 5 cm, pitch of 0.287 and modulation factor of 3. The complete block was 
placed 4 cm away from the planned target region to reduce the area of the 
internal organs at risk, especially the bone marrow. Dose delivery accuracy was 
verified using point dose verification with a ""Cheese"" phantom (Gammex RMI, 
Middleton, WI), 3D plane dose verification with ArcCHECK (Model 1220, Sun 
Nuclear, Melbourne, FL), and multipoint film dose verification. Megavoltage 
computed tomography guidance was also utilized to ensure the accuracy of the 
setup and treatment.
RESULTS: A 5-mm-thick 3D-printed suit was used as a bolus to achieve a target 
volume coverage of 95% of the prescribed dose. The conformity index and 
homogeneity index of the lower segment were slightly better than those of the 
upper segment. As the distance from the skin increased, the dose to the bone 
marrow gradually decreased, and the dose to other organs at risk remained within 
clinical requirements. The point dose verification deviation was less than 1%, 
the 3D plane dose verification was greater than 90%, and the multipoint film 
dose verification was less than 3%, all of which confirmed the accuracy of the 
delivered dose. The total treatment time was approximately 1.5 h, which included 
0.5 h of wearing the 3D-printed suit and 1 h with the beam on. Patients only 
experienced mild fatigue, nausea or vomiting, low-grade fever, and grade III 
bone marrow suppression.
CONCLUSION: The use of a 3D-printed suit for total skin helical tomotherapy can 
result in a uniform dose distribution, short treatment time, simple 
implementation process, good clinical outcomes, and low toxicity. This study 
presents an alternative treatment approach that can potentially yield improved 
clinical outcomes for mycosis fungoides.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12938-023-01118-7

tumors has been shown to be clinically beneficial. However, in colorectal cancer 
(CRC), only a subset of patients benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Previously, 
we showed that high cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) levels are 
associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. Recently, we have revealed the 
role of the tumor promoter CysLT1R in drug resistance and stemness in colon 
cancer (CC) cells. Here, we show the role of the CysLT1R/Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
axis in the regulation of PD-L1 using both in vitro and in vivo preclinical 
model systems. Interestingly, we found that both endogenous and IFNγ-induced 
PD-L1 expression in CC cells is mediated through upregulation of CysLT1R, which 
enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Therapeutic targeting of CysLT1R with its 
antagonist montelukast (Mo), as well as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated or 
doxycycline-inducible functional absence of CysLT1R, negatively regulated PD-L1 
expression in CC cells. Interestingly, an anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody 
exhibited stronger effects together with the CysLT1R antagonist in cells (Apcmut 
or CTNNB1mut) with either endogenous or IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression. 
Additionally, mice treated with Mo showed depletion of PD-L1 mRNA and protein. 
Moreover, in CC cells with combined treatment of a Wnt inhibitor and an 
anti-PD-L1 antibody was effective only in β-catenin-dependent (APCmut) context. 
Finally, analysis of public dataset showed positive correlations between the 
PD-L1 and CysLT1R mRNA levels. These results elucidate a previously 
underappreciated CysLT1R/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the context of PD-L1 
inhibition in CC, which might be considered for improving the efficacy of 
anti-PD-L1 therapy in CC patients. Video Abstract.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12964-023-01157-6

malignancies and are considered a rare type of ovarian cancer. GCTs are 
characterized by irregular genital bleeding after menopause due to female 
hormone production as well as late recurrence around 5-10 years after initial 
treatment. In this study, we investigated two cases of GCTs to find a biomarker 
that can be used to evaluate the treatment and predict recurrence.
CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was a 56-year-old woman who presented to our hospital 
with abdominal pain and distention. An abdominal tumor was found, and GCTs were 
diagnosed. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels decreased 
after surgery. Case 2 involved a 51-year-old woman with refractory GCTs. 
Carboplatin-paclitaxel combination therapy and bevacizumab were administered 
after the tumor resection. After chemotherapy, a decline in VEGF levels was 
observed, but serum VEGF levels increased again with disease progression.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Late diagnosis is one of the major confounders in oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC). Despite recent advances in molecular diagnostics, no 
disease-specific biomarkers are clinically available for early risk prediction 
of OSCC. Therefore, it is important to identify robust biomarkers that are 
detectable using non-invasive liquid biopsy techniques to facilitate the early 
diagnosis of oral cancer. This study identified potential salivary 
exosome-derived miRNA biomarkers and crucial miRNA-mRNA networks/underlying 
mechanisms responsible for OSCC progression.
METHODS: Small RNASeq (n = 23) was performed in order to identify potential 
miRNA biomarkers in both tissue and salivary exosomes derived from OSCC 
patients. Further, integrated analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
datasets (n = 114), qPCR validation on larger patient cohorts (n = 70) and 
statistical analysis with various clinicopathological parameters was conducted 
to assess the effectiveness of the identified miRNA signature. miRNA-mRNA 
networks and pathway analysis was conducted by integrating the transcriptome 
sequencing and TCGA data. The OECM-1 cell line was transfected with the 
identified miRNA signature in order to observe its effect on various functional 
mechanisms such as cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasive as well 
as migratory potential and the downstream signaling pathways regulated by these 
miRNA-mRNA networks.
RESULTS: Small RNASeq and TCGA data identified 12 differentially expressed 
miRNAs in OSCC patients compared to controls. On validating these findings in a 
larger cohort of patients, miR-140-5p, miR-143-5p, and miR-145-5p were found to 
be significantly downregulated. This 3-miRNA signature demonstrated higher 
efficacy in predicting disease progression and clinically correlated with poor 
prognosis (p < 0.05). Transcriptome, TCGA, and miRNA-mRNA network analysis 
identified HIF1a, CDH1, CD44, EGFR, and CCND1 as hub genes regulated by the 
miRNA signature. Further, transfection-mediated upregulation of the 3-miRNA 
signature significantly decreased cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, 
resulted in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and reduced the invasive and migratory 
potential by reversing the EMT process in the OECM-1 cell line.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study identifies a 3-miRNA signature that can be 
utilized as a potential biomarker for predicting disease progression of OSCC and 
uncovers the underlying mechanisms responsible for converting a normal 
epithelial cell into a malignant phenotype.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40364-023-00505-5

higher among those with a mental health condition (MHC). Vaping can help some 
people quit smoking, but little is known about vaping among people with MHCs or 
psychological distress. We assessed the prevalence and characteristics 
(heaviness, product type) of smoking and/or vaping among those with and without 
a history of single or multiple MHC diagnoses and with no, moderate or serious 
psychological distress.
METHODS: Data from 27,437 adults in Great Britain surveyed between 2020 and 
2022. Multinomial regressions analysed associations between smoking, vaping and 
dual use prevalence, smoking/vaping characteristics and (a) history of a single 
or multiple MHC and (b) moderate or serious psychological distress, adjusted for 
age, gender, and socioeconomic status.
RESULTS: Compared with people who had never smoked, those who currently smoked 
were more likely to report a history of a single (12.5% vs 15.0%, AOR=1.62, 95% 
CI=1.46-1.81, p<.001) or multiple MHCs (12.8% vs 29.3%, AOR=2.51, 95% 
CI=2.28-2.75, p<.001). Compared with non-vapers, current vapers were more likely 
to report a history of a single (13.5% vs 15.5%, AOR=1.28, 95% CI=1.11-1.48, 
p<.001) or multiple MHCs (15.5% vs 33.4%, AOR=1.66, 95% CI=1.47-1.87, p<.001). 
Dual users were more likely to report a history of multiple MHCs (36.8%), but 
not a single MHC than exclusive smokers (27.2%) and exclusive vapers (30.4%) 
(all p<.05). Similar associations were reported for those with moderate or 
serious psychological distress. Smoking roll-your-own cigarettes and smoking 
more heavily, were associated with a history of single or multiple MHCs. There 
were no associations between vaping characteristics and a history of MHCs. 
Frequency of vaping, device type and nicotine concentration differed by 
psychological distress.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, vaping and dual use were substantially higher among those 
with a history of MHC, especially multiple MHC, and experiencing past month 
distress than those not having a history of MHC or experiencing past month 
distress respectively. Analysis used descriptive epidemiology and causation 
cannot be determined.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12916-023-02890-y

(#)Contributed equally","INTRODUCTION: At present, clinical factors and hematological indicators have 
been proved to have great potential in predicting the prognosis of cancer 
patients, and no one has combined these two valuable indicators to establish a 
prognostic model for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients with 
stage T1-3N0M0 after R0 resection. To verify, we aimed to combine these 
potential indicators to establish a prognostic model.
METHODS: Stage T1-3N0M0 ESCC patients from two cancer centers (including 
training cohort: N = 819, and an external validation cohort: N = 177)-who had 
undergone esophagectomy in 1995-2015 were included. We integrated significant 
risk factors for death events by multivariable logistic regression methods and 
applied them to the training cohort to build Esorisk. The parsimonious aggregate 
Esorisk score was calculated for each patient; the training set was divided into 
three prognostic risk classes according to the 33rd and 66th percentiles of the 
Esorisk score. The association of Esorisk with cancer-specific survival (CSS) 
was assessed using Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: The Esorisk model was: [10 + 0.023 × age + 0.517 × drinking 
history - 0.012 × hemoglobin-0.042 × albumin - 0.032 × lymph nodes]. Patients 
were grouped into three classes-Class A (5.14-7.26, low risk), Class B 
(7.27-7.70, middle risk), and Class C (7.71-9.29, high risk). In the training 
group, five-year CSS decreased across the categories (A: 63%; B: 52%; C: 30%, 
Log-rank P < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in the validation group. 
Additionally, Cox regression analysis showed that Esorisk aggregate score 
remained significantly associated with CSS in the training cohort and validation 
cohort after adjusting for other confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: We combined the data of two large clinical centers, and 
comprehensively considered their valuable clinical factors and hematological 
indicators, established and verified a new prognostic risk classification that 
can predict CSS of stage T1-3N0M0 ESCC patients.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13019-023-02294-2
